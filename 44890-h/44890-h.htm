<p class="drop-capi1">CONSIDERING that this short study
can claim to be nothing more than a
rapid and somewhat summary survey
of the history of <span class="smcap">The Book</span>, it
eschews all controversial matter, nor
does it pretend to convey much fresh
information to those already possessing a special knowledge
of the subject. It is rather a condensed, but at
the same time, it may be hoped, a useful, compendium
of the thousand unknown or now forgotten essays, involving
endless contradictory statements, that have been
issued on this theme. The mere enumeration of such
works would simply suffice to fill a volume. We have
accordingly no intention to attempt a bibliography,
satisfying ourselves with the modest avowal of having
found so many documents in all languages, that the
very abundance has been at least as embarrassing to
us as the lack of materials may have been to others.</p>

<p>The Book appealing in its present form to a special
public interested more in artistic than in purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span> typographical
topics, our attention has been more particularly
given to the illustrators, the designers, engravers,
etchers, and so forth. Such graphic embellishment
seemed to us of more weight than the manufacture of
the paper, the type-casting, the printing properly so
called. This technical aspect of the subject has been
very briefly dealt with in a separate chapter, and has
also been enlarged upon in the early section. To the
binding also we have devoted only a single chapter,
while fully conscious that a whole volume would not
have sufficed merely to treat the subject superficially.</p>

<p>At the same time, we would not have the reader
conclude from all this that our book abounds in omissions,
or has overlooked any important features. The
broad lines, we trust, have been adhered to, while each
section has been so handled as to give a fair idea of
the epoch it deals with. This is the first attempt to
comprise within such narrow limits an art and an industry
with a life of over four centuries, essaying to
describe its beginnings and its history down to our
days, without omitting a glance at the allied arts.</p>

<p>The engravings selected for illustration have, as far
as possible, been taken from unedited materials, and
have been directly reproduced by mechanical processes,
while fifteen new illustrations, having special relation
to the history of the Book in England, have been added
to this edition, which is also considerably enlarged in
the text on the same subject.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi1">LIKE its forerunner, Painting, the
Book has ever been the most faithful
reflection of the times when it
was written and illustrated. Natural
and genuine from the first, and
simply embellished with crude illustrations,
it assumed in the sixteenth century the grand
airs of the Renaissance, gay or serious according to
circumstances, decked in what were then called <i>histoires</i>&mdash;that
is to say, wonderful engravings&mdash;and
daintily printed in Gothic, Roman, or choice Italic
characters. But at the close of the century it had
already abandoned <i>wood</i> for line engravings, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>heightening
its mysticism or its satire at the whim of passing
politics and religious wranglings. Then, under the
influence of the painters and courtiers of the <i>Grand
Monarque</i>, it becomes completely transformed, donning
the peruke, so to speak, indulging in allegory and
conventionalities, pompous and showy, tricking itself
out in columns and pilasters instead of the old
arabesques and scroll work of the Renaissance, thus
continuing amid the coquetries of the regency, the
pastorals and insipidities of the following reigns, until
at last it suddenly assumes with the heroes of the
Revolution the austere mien and airs of classic art.
The Book has always been as closely connected with
the manners of our predecessors as art itself. The
artist submits more than he thinks to the tendency
of his surroundings; and if he at times makes his
taste appreciated, it is because he has more or less
received his first influence from others.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the fashion of emblematic
representation placed under the portrait of Gaston de
Foix a figure of a young plant in full bloom; and
the inscription in Latin was "Nascendo maturus"&mdash;"Mature
at birth." The Book deserves the same
device; from its first day up to now it is a marvel
of simplicity and harmony. The tentative efforts
which preceded the discovery of printing were but few;
it may be said that from the moment that Gutenberg
conceived the idea of separating the characters, of
arranging the words in the forme, of inking them, and of
taking a proof on paper, the Book was perfect. At best
we see in following times some modifications of detail;
the art of printing was mature, mature from its birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>But before arriving at the movable type placed side
by side, and forming phrases, which appears to us to-day
so simple and so ordinary, many years passed. It is
certain that long before Gutenberg a means was found
of cutting wood and metal in relief and reproducing
by application the image traced. Signs-manual and
seals were a kind of printing, inasmuch as the relief of
their engraving is impressed upon a sheet by the hand.
But between this simple statement and the uncritical
histories of certain special writers, attributing the
invention of engraving to the fourteenth century, there
is all the distance of legendary history. Remembering
that the numerous guilds of <i>tailleurs d'images</i>, or
sculptors in relief, had in the Middle Ages the specialty
of carving ivories and of placing effigies on
tombs, it can be admitted without much difficulty, that
these people one day found a means of multiplying
the sketches of a figure often asked for, by modelling
its contour in relief on ivory or wood, and afterwards
taking a reproduction on paper or parchment by
means of pressure. When and where was this discovery
produced? We cannot possibly say; but it
is certain that playing cards were produced by this
means, and that from the year 1423 popular figures
were cut in wood, as we know from the St. Christopher
of that date belonging to Lord Spencer.</p>

<p>It is not our task to discuss this question at length,
nor to decide if at first these reliefs were obtained on
wood or metal. It is a recognised fact that the single
sheet with a printed figure preceded the xylographic
book in which text and illustration were cut in the same
block. This process did not appear much before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
second quarter of the fifteenth century, and it was employed
principally for popular works which were then the
universal taste. The engraving also was nothing more
than a kind of imposition palmed off as a manuscript;
the vignettes were often covered with brilliant colours
and gold, and the whole sold as of the best quality.</p>

<p>The first attempts at these little figures in relief discovered
by the image-makers and diffused by the
makers of playing cards were but indifferent. The
drawing and the cutting were equally unskilful, as may
be seen in the facsimiles given by M. H. Delaborde in
his <i>Histoire de la Gravure</i>. An attempt had been made
to put some text at the foot of the St. Christopher of
1423, and the idea of giving more importance to the text
was to the advantage of the booksellers. At the mercy
of the writers who fleeced them, obliged to recoup
themselves by the exaggerated prices of the most ordinary
books, they hoped to turn engraving to account
in order to obtain on better terms the technical work
needed for their trade. At the epoch of the St. Christopher,
in 1423, several works were in vogue in the
universities, the schools, and with the public. Among
the first of these was the Latin Syntax of &AElig;lius
Donatus on the eight parts of speech, a kind of grammar
for the use of young students, as well as the famous
<i>Speculum</i>, a collection of precepts addressed to the
faithful, which were copied and recopied without
satisfying the demand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
  <a href="images/i_013f.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" />
  </a>
  <p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Part of a <i>Donatus</i> taken from a xylograph, the
original of which is preserved in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale.</p>
</div>

<p>To find a means of multiplying these treatises at
little cost was a fortune to the inventor. It is to be
supposed that many artisans of the time attempted it;
and without doubt it was the booksellers themselves,
mostly mere dealers, who were tempted to the adventure
by the sculptors and wood-cutters. But none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
had yet been so bold as to cut in relief a series of blocks
with engravings and text to compose a complete work.
That point was reached very quickly when some legend
was engraved at the foot of a vignette, and it may be
thought that the <i>Donatus</i> was the most ancient of books
so obtained among the "Incunabuli," as we now call
them, a word that signifies origin or cradle.</p>

<p>The first books then were formed of sheets of paper
or parchment, laboriously printed from xylographic
blocks, that is to say wooden blocks on which a
<i>tailleur d'images</i> had left in relief the designs and
the letters of the text. He had thus to trace his characters
in reverse, so that they could be reproduced
as written; he had to avoid faults, because a phrase
once done, well or ill, lasted. It was doubtless this
difficulty of correction that gave the idea of movable
types. If the cutter seriously erred, it was necessary
to cancel altogether the faulty block. This at least
explains the legend of Laurent Coster, of Haarlem, who,
according to Hadrian Junius, his compatriot, discovered
by accident the secret of separate types while playing
with his children. And if the legend of which we
speak contains the least truth, it must be found in the
sense above indicated, that is in the correction of
faults, rather than in the innocent game of a merchant
of Haarlem. However, we shall have occasion to
return to the subject of these remarks. It should be
well established that engraving in relief on wood alone
gave the idea of making xylographic blocks and of
composing books. Movable type, the capital point of
printing, the pivot of the art of the Book, developed
itself little by little, according to needs, when there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
occasion to correct an erroneous inscription; but, in
any case, its origin is unknown. Doubtless to vary
the text, means were found to replace entire phrases
by other phrases, preserving the original figures; and
thus the light dawned upon these craftsmen, occupied
in the manufacture and sale of their books.</p>

<p>According to Hadrian Junius, Laurent Janszoon
Coster (the latter name signifying "the discoverer")
published one of the celebrated series of works
under the general title of <i>Speculum</i> which was then
so popular (the mystic style exercising so great an
attraction on the people of the fifteenth century), the
<i>Speculum Human&aelig; Salvationis</i>. Written before the
middle of the fifteenth century, made popular by manuscripts,
in spite of its fantastic Latinity and of its
false quantities, this ascetic and crude poem was easy
of access to the xylographists. Junius, as we see,
attributes to Laurent Coster the first impression of the
<i>Speculum</i>, no longer the purely xylographic impression
of the <i>Donatus</i> from an engraved block, but that
of the more advanced manner in movable types. In
point of fact, this book had at least four editions,
similar in engravings and body of letters, but of different
text. It must then be admitted that the fount
was dispersed, and typography discovered, because the
same cast of letters could not be adapted to different
languages. On the other hand, the vignettes do not
change, indicating sufficiently the mobility of the types.
In comparison to what may be seen in later works, the
illustrations of the <i>Speculum</i> are by no means bad; they
have the appearance, at once na&iuml;ve and picturesque, of
the works of Van Eyck, and not at all of the style of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the German miniaturists; properly illuminated and
gilded, they lent themselves to the illusion of being
confounded with the <i>histoyres</i>, drawn by the hand,
and this is what the publisher probably sought.</p>

<p>All the xylographic works of the fifteenth century
may be classed in two categories: the xylographs,
rightly so called, or the block books, such as the
<i>Donatus</i>, and the books with movable types, like the
<i>Speculum</i>, of which we speak. This mystic and
simple literature of pious works for the use of people
of modest resources found in printing the means of
more rapid reproduction. Then appeared the <i>Biblia
Pauperum</i>, one of the most celebrated and the most
often reproduced, and the <i>Ars Moriendi</i>, a kind of
dialogue between an angel and a devil at the bedside
of a dying person, which, inspired no doubt by older
manuscripts, retained for a long time in successive
editions the first tradition of its designs. On labels
displayed among the figures are found inscribed the
dialogue of the demons and angels seeking to attach to
themselves the departing soul, the temptations of Satan
on the subject of faith, and the responses of the angel
on the same subject.</p>

<p>We can see what developments this theme could lend
to the mysticism of the fifteenth century. Composed
in eleven designs, the <i>Ars Moriendi</i> ran up to eight
different editions. From the middle to the end of the
fifteenth century, the text was in Latin, then in French,
under the title <i>L'Art au Morier</i>. In the French
edition will be found the blocks that served for the
second impression of the work. About 1480, more
than fifty years after the first essays, the <i>Ars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Moriendi</i> enjoyed so much vogue that it employed all
the resources of typography as much as in its earliest
days. The original subjects, copied in a very mediocre
manner, adorned the text, which was composed in
Gothic letters, with a new and more explicit title:
<i>Tractatus brevis ac valde utilis de Arte et Scientia bene</i>
<i>moriendi</i> (4to, s.l.n.d.), but the order is inverted, figure 5
of the xylograph becoming No. 3 of the edition of 1480.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Ars Memorandi</i>, another xylographic work, of
which the subject, taken from the New Testament, was
equally well adapted to the imagination of the artists,
had also a glorious destiny. The work originally comprised
thirty blocks, the fifteen blocks of text facing the
fifteen engravings. The designs represented the attributes
of each of the Evangelists, with allegories and
explanatory legends. Thus, in that which relates to
the Apostle Matthew,</p>

<p>No. 1 represents the birth and genealogy of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>No. 2 the offerings of the Magi,</p>
<p>No. 3 the baptism of St. John,</p>
<p>No. 4 the Temptation of Christ,</p>
<p>No. 5 the Sermon on the Mount,</p>
<p>No. 6 the parable of the birds.</p>

<p>The angel that supports the whole is the emblem of
St. Matthew the Evangelist.</p>

<p>This mnemonic treatment of the Gospels began with
symbols of which we have no means of finding the
origin, but which without doubt were employed many
centuries earlier. However that may be, their success
was as great as that of the already-quoted works. In
1505 a German publisher put forth an imitation, under
the title of <i>Rationarium Evangelistarum</i>; and this
time the copier of the illustrations, retaining the tradition
of the first xylographers, no less reveals an artist
of the first order, at least a pupil of Martin Schongauer.
Some of the conceptions of the <i>Rationarium</i> recall
exactly the engravings of the great German master,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
among others that of the Infant Jesus (plate 12), which
nearly approaches the style of the Infant Jesus of
Schongauer; besides, the principal figures leave but
little doubt on the subject. The same wings are on the
angels and on the eagles, the same coiffures on the
human characters, often the same attitudes.</p>

<p>From the preceding can be judged the extraordinary
favour these productions enjoyed. From their origin
they were diffused through the whole of Europe, and
attracted the attention of excellent artists. Nevertheless
their beginnings were difficult. The movable types
used, cut separately in wood, were not constituted to give
an ideal impression. We can understand the cost that
the execution of these characters must have occasioned,
made as they were one by one without the possibility
of ever making them perfectly uniform. Progress
was to substitute for this irregular process types that
were similar, identical, easily produced, and used for
a long time without breaking. Following on the essays
of Laurent Coster, continuous researches bore on this
point; but as the invention was said to be his, and it
being of importance to him not to divulge it, so that he
should not lose his profit, much time was lost over it
in his workshop without much success. Here history is
somewhat confused. Hadrian Junius positively accuses
one of Laurent Coster's workmen of having stolen
the secrets of his master and taken flight to Mayence,
where he afterwards founded a printing office. According
to Junius, the metal type was the discovery of
the Dutchman, and the name of the thief was John.
Who was this John? Was it John Gaensefleisch, called
Gutenberg, or possibly John Fust? But it is not at
all apparent that Gutenberg, a gentleman of Mayence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
exiled from his country, was ever in the service of the
Dutch inventor. As to Fust, we believe his only intervention
in the association of printers of Mayence
was as a money-lender, from which may be comprehended
the unlikelihood of his having been with Coster,
the more so as we find Gutenberg retired to Strasbourg,
where he pursued his researches. There he was, as
it were, out of his sphere, a ruined noble whose great
knowledge was bent entirely on invention. Doubtless,
like many others, he may have had in his hands one of
the printed works of Laurent Coster, and conceived
the idea of appropriating the infant process. In 1439
he was associated with two artisans of the city of Strasbourg,
ostensibly in the fabrication of mirrors, which
may be otherwise understood as printing of <i>Speculums</i>,
the Latin word signifying the same thing. These men
needed to surround themselves with precautions;
printing was as yet only a practical means of multiplying
manuscripts, to impose a little on the innocent,
and fortune awaited him who, without saying anything,
made this invention serve him. The following will
prove this, as well as its tendency.</p>

<p>A legal document discovered in 1760 by Wencker
and Schoepflin in the Pfennigthurm of Strasbourg,
and afterwards translated into French by M. Leon de
Laborde, makes us at length acquainted with the work
of Gutenberg and of his associates Andrew Dritzehen
and Andrew Heilmann. Apparently these three men
were, as we have said, <i>Spiegelmacher</i>, that is makers
of mirrors. They had jointly entered into a deed by
the terms of which, if one of the partners died in the
course of their researches, his heirs would have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
rights beyond an indemnity corresponding to the amount
invested by him. It happened that Andrew Dritzehen
did die, and that one of his brothers aspired to occupy
his place in the partnership. The dead man left debts
behind him; he had squandered his florins by hundreds
in his experiments. Gutenberg having offered to pay
the amounts expended, the heirs of Dritzehen, who
wanted more, summoned him before the courts to show
why he should not make place for them in the work of
experiments and making of mirrors. The witnesses in
their testimony before the court told what they knew
of the inventions of the partnership. One among them
deposed that after the death of Dritzehen, Gutenberg's
servant went to the workshop and begged Nicholas
Dritzehen, brother of the deceased, to displace and
break up four formes placed in a press. A second testified
that the works of Andrew had cost him at the least
three hundred florins, an enormous sum for those days.
Other witnesses painted Gutenberg in a curious light:
they made him out to be a savage, a hermit, who concealed
from his associates certain arts of which the deed
stipulated nothing. One fact proved that the experiments
referred to the manufacture of metallic characters.
A goldsmith, named D&uuml;nne, maintained that he
had received more than a hundred florins for printing
material "das zu dem trucken gehoret." "Trucken!"&mdash;"Typography!"
The word was found, and from that
day usage has consecrated it.</p>

<p>Before 1439, then, John Gaensefleisch, or Gutenberg,
was devoted to the art of reproduction of texts, and
had consecrated his life and feeble resources to it.
Three problems presented themselves to him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
wanted types less fragile than wooden types and less
costly than engraving. He wanted a press by the aid of
which he could obtain a clear impression on parchment
or paper. He desired also that the leaves of his books
should not be anopistograph, or printed only on one
side. There were many unknown things to vex his soul,
of which he himself alone could have a presentiment.
Until then, and even long after, the xylographs were
printed <i>au frotton</i> or with a brush, rubbing the paper
upon the forme coated with ink, thicker than ordinary
ink. He dreamed of something better.</p>

<p>In the course of his work John Gutenberg returned
to Mayence. The idea of publishing a Bible, the Book
of books, had taken possession of his heart. The
<i>Spiegelmacher</i> of Strasbourg was on the road to loss.
The cutting of his types had ruined him, and on his
arrival in his native town, his stock in trade, transported
by him, was of no great weight: some boxes of type,
an inconvenient forme, and perhaps an ordinary press,
a wine-maker's press, with a wooden screw. The idea
of using this unwieldy instrument for the impression of
his formes had already occurred to him; but would not
the <i>frotton</i> serve still better? The force of the blow
from the bar would break the miserable type, the raised
parts of which could not resist the repeated strokes.
In this unhappy situation, Gutenberg made the acquaintance
of a financier of Mayence, named Fust, who was
in search of a business, and who put a sum of eleven
hundred florins at his disposal to continue his experiments.
Unfortunately this money disappeared, it
melted away, and the results obtained were absolutely
ludicrous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>It is certain that John Fust did not enter on the engagement
without protecting himself. From the first he
bound his debtor in a contract for six per cent. interest,
besides a share in the profits. In addition he stipulated
repayment in case of failure. Gutenberg, improvident,
as is the way of inventors, had signed away all that
he possessed to procure funds. It is presumed, besides,
that during the continuance of his investigations, he
composed some current books with the resources at
his disposal, that served a little to lighten his debts.
But the printing house of the Zum Jungen at Mayence
was far from shining in the world, because the association
of Fust concerned itself only with the publication
of a Bible, and not at all with the <i>Speculums</i>
and <i>Donatuses</i> that were so much in vogue at this
time. Besides, the money-lender made a point of
pressing his debtor, and did not allow him any leisure
to labour outside the projected work. About this time
a third actor enters on the scene. Peter Schoeffer, of
Gernsheim, a writer, introduced into the workshop of
Gutenberg to design letters, benefited by the abortive
experiments, and taking up the invention at its deadlock,
conducted it to success. John of Tritenheim,
called Trithemius, the learned abbot of Spanheim, is
the person who relates these facts; but as he got his
information from Schoeffer himself, too much credence
must not be given to his statements. Besides, Schoeffer
was not at all an ordinary artisan. If we credit a
Strasbourg manuscript written by his hand in 1449, he
was a student of the "most glorious university of
Paris." In the workshop of Gutenberg, his industrious
and inventive intellect found a fecund mine, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
caligraphist dreamt of other things than shaping letters
for the use of wood engravers. Gutenberg, arrested
in his career by the wants of life, the worries of business,
and perhaps also the fatigues of his labours,
may have let the new-comer know something of his
experiences. One cannot know, but it is certain that,
shortly after, John Fust was so fascinated by Schoeffer,
so attracted by his youth and his application, that he
resolved to put new capital into the business. He
did more: to permanently attach him, he gave him
his grand-daughter in marriage, not his daughter, as
was thought until M. Auguste Bernard rectified this
mistake.</p>

<p>We have now come to 1453, the year preceding the
first dated monument of printing in movable types: <i>the
letters of indulgence</i>. It may be acknowledged that
the sudden affection of Fust for his workman depended
on some interested motive, and not at all on attraction
of the heart. Had this former student of the university
of Paris found the means of rapidly founding
metallic types, the search for which had cost Gutenberg
many sleepless nights? Had he completed it by applying
to it the matrix and punch which had then and
for centuries served the makers of seals and the money-coiners?
Perhaps, as was most probable, the two associates
had agreed, and putting their experiences together,
had conquered hitherto insurmountable difficulties.</p>

<p>The year 1454 witnessed the diffusion throughout
Christendom of letters of indulgence, accorded by Pope
Nicholas V., who wished to aid in funds the King
of Cyprus against the Turks. These circular letters,
scattered by thousands to every corner of the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
employed numerous copyists. Arrived at Mayence,
the distributers found a workshop ready prepared to
furnish copies in the shortest possible time. They
set to work and brought together all the type they
possessed, cast or engraved, to set up these famous
letters. Among the impressions was that of which we
give a reproduction, which belongs to the edition called
that of thirty-one lines. The original was delivered
for a consideration to Josse Ott von Mospach on the
31st of December, 1454.</p>

<p>It is not without interest, for the history of the Book
and of printing, to note here that these letters of
indulgence, the clandestine traffic in which was largely
accelerated by rapidity of production and the small
cost of each copy, formed one of the causes of the
religious reform of Martin Luther. They afforded a
means of raising money, and were so generally resorted
to that in the register of the Hotel de Ville of Paris
preserved in the Archives Nationales (H 1778) it may
be seen that the sheriffs requested the Pope to allow
them to employ them in the reconstruction of the
bridge at the Hotel de Ville.</p>

<p>The ice once broken, Fust and Schoeffer found it
hard to nourish a useless mouth. For them Gutenberg
was more of a hindrance than a profit, and they
sought brutally to rid themselves of him. Fust had
a most easy pretext, which was to demand purely
and simply from his associate the sums advanced by
him, and which had produced so little. Gutenberg
had probably commenced his Bible, but, in face of the
claims of Fust, he had to abandon it altogether, types,
formes, and press.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>In November, 1455, he had retired to a little house
outside the city, where he tried his best, by the aid of
foreign help, to establish a workshop, and to preserve the
most perfect secrecy. Relieved of his company, Fust
and Schoeffer were able to take up the impression of
the Bible and to complete it without him. If matters
did so happen, and Schoeffer had not the excuse that
he had previously discovered the casting of type, there
is but one word to designate his conduct: robbery, and
moral robbery, the worst of all. But what can be said
to-day of these people?</p>

<p>One thing is certain: that the Bible of Schoeffer, commenced
by Gutenberg or not, put on sale by Fust and
Schoeffer alone about the end of 1455 or beginning of
1456, proves to be the first completed book. Retired
to his new quarters, Gutenberg was taking courage, so
as not to appear too much behindhand, but the reconstitution
of his workshop cost him enormous time.
And, besides, he missed the letter-maker Schoeffer, his
own Gothic letters, engraved on steel with a punch,
not having the same elegance. When his work
appeared, it could not sustain comparison. The Bible of
Schoeffer was more compact, the impression was more
perfect, the ink better, the type less irregular. The
original inventor, in his business with Fust, made an
unhappy competition for himself. We give here a
fragment of this celebrated book, a kind of mute witness
of the science and mortifications of the first printer. It
is now called the Mazarine Bible, from the fact that
the copy in the Mazarin Library was the first to give
evidence concerning it. The book was put on sale at
the end of 1455 or beginning of 1456, for a manuscript<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
note of a vicar of St. Stephen at Mayence records that
he finished the binding and illuminating of the first
volume on St. Bartholomew's Day, 1456, and the second
on the 15th of August. St. Bartholomew's Day is the
13th of June, and not the 24th of August, as the
catalogue of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale has it.</p>

</div>

<p>All these remarks show that the printers did not proclaim
themselves, and were making pseudo-manuscripts.
They did not make known their names or address.
The rubricators sided with them, for many of the copies
are illuminated with as much care and beauty as if they
were the finest manuscripts.</p>

<p>There is no record extant of the number of copies
printed, but it was done on both vellum and paper.
Copies are by no means uncommon, most of the great
libraries having one, and many are in private collections.
One is shown among the typographical monuments in
the King's Library of the British Museum, and there is
a finely illuminated copy in the show-room of the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale. From its very great importance as
the first book that is known to have been printed, its
value has a constant increase. Of the copies recently
sold, one at the Perkins sale in 1873 on vellum sold
for &pound;3,400, another on paper at the same sale fetched
&pound;2,900, while one on paper in the Syston Park Library
sold in December, 1884, for &pound;3,900. It has been asserted
that the copies on paper were the first issued by Gutenberg
and his partners, and those on vellum subsequently
printed by Fust and Schoeffer, after they had obtained
possession of the inventor's stock.</p>

<p>But so many copies absolutely similar in aspect, and
of so regular a style, put in the market from day to
day by Fust and Schoeffer, gave rise to protests from
the caligraphists. Criticism always attends upon success,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
but having obtained the result, the two associates
did not hesitate to proclaim themselves the printers of
the Bible. On the publication of the Psalter, which
followed the Bible at a year's interval, they gave their
names and added a date, 1457, the first instance of a
date being recorded in a book. This second work was
of so skilful a typography, that it might have been
shown as the work of an expert penman; the faults
remarked in the letters of indulgence are no longer
seen; type had attained perfection; in two years
printing had reached its culminating point.</p>

<p>In spite of his disappointments, Gutenberg did not
rest idle. If he had seen his two enemies rob him of
his claim of priority in the invention, he had to show
that, reduced to his own exertions and to the restricted
means furnished him by charitable people, he also
could print well. Two years after the Bible a dated
book, composed in Gothic letters, appeared at Mayence;
this was the <i>Catholicon</i> of John Balbus, of Genoa.
It had not yet occurred to these first printers to exercise
their art otherwise than on religious works. It
is admitted by general opinion that the <i>Catholicon</i>
issued from the press of Gutenberg; on the other
hand, M. Bernard believes that it ought to be attributed
to a printer of Eltvil, who published in 1467 a vocabulary
called the <i>Vocabularium ex quo</i> with the same types.
The former theory may be sustained by the words
of the colophon of the book, which is a sort of hymn
to God and a recognition of the city of Mayence without
any mention of the name of the printer. Now in the
situation in which Gutenberg found himself, in the
face of his rivals, had he not some claim to regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the great discovery as his own? But if M. Bernard
is mistaken, and if our supposition has no foundation,
what a beautiful act of humility, what a noble idea of
his character, Gutenberg gives us in writing, "With
the aid of the Most High, Who releases the tongues of
infants and often reveals to babes that which is sealed
to learned men, this admirable book the <i>Catholicon</i> was
finished in the year of the incarnation of our Saviour
MCCCCLX. in the mother-country of Mayence, famous
city of Germany, which God, in His clemency, has
deigned to render the most illustrious and the first
of cities; and this book was perfected without the
usual help of pen or style, but by the admirable linking
of formes and types"!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>The history of these men, it is easy to understand,
has to be regarded with caution, people of so little
consequence then that the authentic documents relating
to them have for ever disappeared. If we except
that of the Pfennigthurm of Strasbourg, of which we
have before spoken, and the deed of claim for money
from Fust to Gutenberg dated 1455, we are forced
to quote from authors living long afterwards, who
submitted, without knowing better, to the miserable
errors of oral tradition. It is nearly always the same
with men who have occupied a large place in the
history of art; posterity only knows of their genius
at the time when no one knows anything of them.
For Gutenberg the situation was still more terrible;
a rival, Peter Schoeffer, survived him, and he did
not for his own reputation care to preserve his rival's
memory; and if, as is believed, Gutenberg left pupils
and heirs, Henry Bechtermuncze, Ulrich Zell, and
Weigand Spyes, his misfortune is crowned by Bechtermuncze
being now reputed to be the printer of the
<i>Catholicon</i>, of which we have just given the history.
Even Albert Pfister, one of his workmen, dismissed at
the end of his work, having obtained from his master
some rejected types, was presumed later to have invented
printing. We find this artisan established at
Bamberg about 1460, composing Bibles in movable
types, the first known being that published in 1461.
But Albert Pfister showed that he was not at all an
inventor by the mediocrity of his work, and more by
the old types that he used. If he had known the
secret of engraving the punches, he would have cast
new letters and have given a better aspect to his work.</p>

editions with this signature. The above is from the second edition.</p>
</div>

<p>In these statements all is supposition and contradiction.
That which is certain&mdash;and the dates are
there to prove it&mdash;is the enormous progress in the
productions of Peter Schoeffer. In 1459 he published
his third book, Durand's <i>Rationale Divinorum Officiorum</i>,
in folio. As in the Psalter, Schoeffer employed initial
letters printed in red, which the rival workshop could
not do in the <i>Catholicon</i>, the rubrics of which are
painted by hand, as in manuscripts. In time he put
forth a second edition of the Psalter, always with
Fust's name joined to his own. A great number of
types were broken at the beginning, but he dreamed
of doing yet better. In 1460 he gave the <i>Constitutiones</i>
of Pope Clement V., with a gloss and commentaries
by John Andr&eacute;; here was the first example of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
process much employed in manuscripts, but of which the
typographical composition was very difficult. Again,
in 1462 a new Latin Bible issued from their workshops
in two folio volumes. It is the first dated edition. The
first volume has two hundred and forty-two folios in
double columns, the second two hundred and thirty-nine.
It commences with an epistle of St. Jerome, and
on the last leaf of the second volume is the colophon
on the preceding page.</p>

<p>This book, one of the first worthy of the name, and
which is called by preference the Mayence Bible,
appeared in one of the most troubled epochs that the
episcopal city had had to go through. Subject to its
archbishops, who were at the head of all the lay lords
and fighting men, the city found itself in 1462 the prey
of two prelates of equal title who refused to give way
to one another: Thierry of Isembourg and Adolph of
Nassau-Wiesbaden. Adolph surprised Mayence on
the 27th October, 1462, pursuing his adversary, who
scaled the walls with a rope to escape quicker, and the
city was sacked and pillaged from its foundations. In
the middle of this turmoil, what became of the obscure
persons who were then the printers of the Bible?
Doubtless their insignificance saved them from disaster,
but as it was long before peace was re-established, and
the entire edition of their last volume could not be
kept back, we incline to believe that they were for a time
going about the country as itinerant booksellers. Paris
was to them a well-indicated point of travel&mdash;Paris,
toward which all German commerce tended. The
university where Peter Schoeffer was instructed in
letters, and that truly passed for the first in Europe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
appeared to them a market of the first order. If we
may believe Walchius (<i>Decas fabularum generis humani</i>:
Strasbourg, 1609, 4to, p. 181), John Fust himself went
to that city, where he put books on sale from sixty crowns
a copy, then fifty, then forty, according to the prevailing
system in matters of discount. Fust was above all
things a merchant; he led it to be believed that he had
the marvellous establishment of a copyist beyond the
Rhine, and he had disposed of many copies, when the
corporate scribes of the university, becoming aware of
the imposition, cried out furiously and declared it a
diabolical invention. We may now take this tale of
Walchius as a fable, as the registers of Parliament, on
being consulted, rest silent on the proceedings instituted
against the "magician" of Mayence. Only we must not
lose sight of the fact that the booksellers had their
masters, their syndicate, if we may use the modern
word, charged to prohibit fraudulent publications. They
were too much interested in the suppression of printed
books to judge the matter coldly. The Parliament
had nothing to see to in this.</p>

<p>The revolution of Mayence had otherwise great results,
which were not affected by these minor reverses.
The printing workshops, or at least the successors
of Gutenberg, began to be dispersed, and Fust and
Schoeffer having established a school of printers in
the city, their trade was no longer secret. Deprived
of their liberties by the new Archbishop, many of
them expatriated themselves. We shall take occasion
later to name some of these exiles, through whom
the art of printing spread itself almost simultaneously
throughout the world: to Cologne and Strasbourg, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Italy and Spain, without reckoning Holland, France,
Switzerland, and the country around Mayence. We
have before named the episcopal city of Bamberg; it
had the singular fortune to be the second city to possess
a printing office, but it disappeared as quickly as it
was established, with Albert Pfister, without leaving
the least trace; we do not find printing there again
before 1480, more than twenty years later.</p>

<p>Gutenberg was dead before 1468. He was interred
in the Church of the R&eacute;collets of Mayence, by the
pious care of a friend, who attributed the invention
of printing to him on his tomb.</p>

<p>We may begin to comprehend the influence of this
man upon the discovery of which all the world was
then talking, but the troubles of the archiepiscopal
city hampered the respective merit of the inventors.
Peter Schoeffer and John Fust were not much
affected by the political crisis. After two years' suspension,
they reappeared with a Cicero, <i>De Officiis</i>,
1465, quarto, always at work and always surpassing
themselves. This time they freely gave up religious
publications, and, still more extraordinary, they employed
Greek types.</p>

<p>Such is, detached from the incredible contradictions
of writers on art, and sketched solely on its main lines,
the origin of printing as it is established at this day.
First came the image engraved in relief, which we have
not gone to China to find, with some of our predecessors.
Upon this image were often cut, by the same
economical process, legends of explanation that presented
the idea of imitation of manuscript; and the
xylographs appeared with or without illustrations. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
from the correction of errors in these books followed
the discovery of movable characters. This wooden
type, possible when it was used with a <i>frotton</i> for
printing, would quickly break under the press, the
idea of which was gained from the common press of
the wine-makers. Then a kind of metallic type had to
be found which would run in a mould struck by a
punch. This punch was not invented for the purpose;
it served previously for the makers of coins and seals.
The fabrication of type from the matrix was a simple
adoption. The lead thrown into the matrix gave the
desired type. Thus were made the first books, of which
we have briefly related the composition.</p>

<p>As to the proportion of glory due to each one of
the first printers, it is necessary equally, to guard
against error on one side or the other. We have sought
to separate from the heap of publications probable
opinions or those based on certain documents. That
the origin of the <i>Donatus</i>, the block books, was Dutch
would be puerile to deny, because, on one side, the
engravings on blocks are surely of the school of Van
Eyck, and, on the other hand, Ulrich Zell, who inspired
the "Cologne Chronicle" of 1499, assigned positively to
Holland the cradle of the <i>Donatus</i>. At any rate, it was
a pupil of Gutenberg, a question we have discussed.
After that we will trouble ourselves but little about
Laurent Coster. The name makes no difference in a
matter of this kind.</p>

<p>As to Gutenberg, we have not been able to go as far
as M. E. Dutuit, who in his <i>Manuel a'Estampes</i> (vol. i.,
p. 236, etc.) doubts Gutenberg's right to the title of
inventor. It is stated that in a letter of William Fichet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
prior of the Sorbonne, of whom we shall have more to
say presently, to Robert Gaguin, which M. A. Claudin
found at the beginning of a work entitled <i>Gasparim
Pergamensis orthographi&aelig; liber</i>, published in 1470,
nearly twenty years after the first work at Mayence,
Gutenberg is proclaimed the inventor of printing.
Without any other, this testimony of a <i>savant</i> who
was the first to bring the German printers to Paris
appears to us well nigh irrefutable.</p>

<p>As to John Fust and his grandson by marriage,
Peter Schoeffer, they are so well defended by their
works, that there is no more to say here; doubtless
grave presumptions arise as to the delicacy of their
conduct with Gutenberg, but we are not so bold as to
censure them beyond measure. We know nothing
precise either of the time or of the men.</p>

<p>Let us now imagine humble workmen, the most simple
of <i>gens de mestiers</i>, to employ the French expression
then in use, shut up in a kind of dark workshop, like
a country forge, formed in little groups of two or
three persons, one designing and the other cutting the
wood, having near them a table, on which is held the
engraved block after its reliefs have been rubbed with
sombre ink, who afterwards, by means of the <i>frotton</i>,
apply the damped paper to the raised parts of the block;
we shall have without much stretch of thought all the
economy of the xylographic impression. If we add
to this primitive workshop the matrix in which the
types are cast, the box in which they are distributed,
the forme on which they are arranged to compose
the pages, and a small hand-press, with blacker ink and
paper damped to permit the greasy ink to take better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
we have a picture of the work-room of Gutenberg,
Fust, and Schoeffer, and of the first printers with
movable types.</p>

<p>Thus typography was born of painting, passing in
its infancy through wood-cutting, revolutionising ideas
and somewhat the world. But the mighty power of
the new art was not confined to itself; it extended the
circle of engraving, which till then had suffered from the
enormous difficulties of reproduction. As if the time
were ripe for all these things, nearly at the moment when
the first printers were distinguishing themselves by
serious works, a Florentine goldsmith accidentally discovered
the cutting of cast metal.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> What would have
become of this new process if the presses of Gutenberg
had not brought their powerful assistance to the printing
of engravings? It will be found then that printing
rendered a hundredfold to engraving for that which it
received from it and bore it along with its own rapid
advance.</p>

<p>Then reappeared, following the new processes, the
figures somewhat abandoned by the Mayence workmen
during the period of transformation. Our object is to
speak at length of the Book ornamented and illustrated
according to the means of relief-cutting or casting; to
demonstrate the influence of painting, of sculpture, of
art, on the production of the Book; and thus to help
the reader at the same time to understand the almost
sudden and irresistible development of typography,
and to mention its foremost representatives.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi1">CONSIDERING the influence of
printing on the book trade of
the fifteenth century, as referred
to in the preceding pages, the
dealers in manuscripts were not
disposed to give way at the first
blow. An entire class of workmen
would find themselves from day to day without
employment if the new art succeeded; these were the
copyists, miserable scribes, who for meagre remuneration
frequented the shops of the merchants, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
transcribed manuscripts by the year. Before printing
the publication of books was so effected, and the booksellers
were rather intermediaries between the copyist
and the buyer, than direct dealers having shops and
fittings complete. It is evident that they would not
provide themselves with these costly books long in
advance without being sure of disposing of them.</p>

<p>Small as was the remuneration of the writers, it was
much to them; and they were naturally the first to
protest against the new invention. At the same time,
their opposition and that of the booksellers was soon
overcome, swamped, and choked by the growing crowd
of printers. Then, as always happens in similar cases,
in place of fighting against the current, most of the
former workers in manuscript followed it. The writers
designed letters for engraving in wood, the booksellers
sold the printed works, and some of the illuminators
engraved in relief or cast their <i>histoyres</i>. For a long
time these last continued to decorate books with the
ornamental drawings with which they had adorned the
manuscripts, and so contributed to form the fine school
of illustrators who carried their art to so high a point
from the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>As previously related, the revolution of Mayence
caused the flight of a crowd of artisans who found their
liberty suddenly compromised by the conqueror. The
want of money at this time always brought a diminution
of patronage, and working printers have been at
all times tenacious of their privileges. It so happened
that their guild, in place of remaining established at
Mayence many years longer, was, as it were, turned
out, scattered to the four cardinal points by the dispersion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of its members, and scattered many years before
the natural time. In point of fact, in the common
order of things, a workman here and there quits the
principal workshop to try the world. He makes his
way timidly, unconscious apostle of a marvellous
art. If he succeeds,
he gathers
some pupils
round him; if he
fails, no trace of
him remains; in
any case invention
propagates
itself more
gradually. With
printing it was a
thunderclap.
Hardly had it
made its appearance
when the
exodus commenced.
The
greater part of
the Mayence men
went to Italy: to
Subiaco and to
Rome, Arnold Pannartz, Conrad Sweynheim, Ulrich
Hahn; to Venice, John of Spire, Vendelin of Spire,
Christopher Valdarfer, Bernard Pictor (of Augsburg),
Erhardt Ratdolt, Peter Loslein; to Ferrara, Andrew
Belfort; to Foligno, John Neumeister; Henry Alding
tried Sicily; Andrew Vyel, of Worms, printed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Palermo. Lambert Palmart was at Valencia, in Spain,
in 1477; Nicholas Spindeler at Barcelona; Peter
Hagenbach at Toledo; not far from Mayence&mdash;that
is, at Cologne&mdash;Ulrich Zell, a pupil of Gutenberg,
who dated his first work 1466. It was Arnold Ther
Hoernen who numbered a book with Arabic figures;
it was Koelhof who first used signatures to indicate
to the binder the order of the sheets; it was at Eltvil
that Henry Bechtermuncze, as we have already said,
printed his <i>Vocabularium</i> in German, with the types of
the <i>Catholicon</i>; at Basle, Berthold R&uuml;ppel, of Hanau, was
the first established in that city which after Mayence
did the most for printing; at Nuremberg, Koburger,
who took nearly the first rank among his contemporaries,
set as many as twenty-four presses to work,
and was named by Badius the prince of printers. And
how matters went on! For instance, the very year that
followed the death of Gutenberg, monks, the Brothers
of the Common Life of Marienthal, in the Rheingau,
themselves published a copy of the indulgences accorded
by Adolph of Nassau, Archbishop of Mayence. Before
1480, presses were everywhere in Germany: at Prague,
Augsburg, Ulm, Lubeck, Essling, etc.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Imprint of Arnold Ther Hoernen, printer, of
Mayence.</p>
</div>

<p>It is to be remarked that the Mayence men did not
turn towards Holland. Is it that they found there
the descendants of Laurent Coster firmly established
in their workshops? Must the coexistence, the simultaneous
advance, of the invention in Germany and in
the Low Countries be admitted? It is a secret for
us and for many others, but we know for certain that
Flemish printers were established at Utrecht in 1473,
at Delft, Bruges, Gouda, Zwoll, Antwerp, and Brussels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
At Louvain there was besides John of Westphalia,
who published in 1474 a work of Peter Crescens, and
several other works.</p>

<p>Colard Mansion was printing at Bruges about 1473;
and was employed by William Caxton, who had been
for some years trading as a merchant in the Low
Countries, to print the "Recuyell of the Histories of
Troy," by Raoul Le Fevre, which Caxton had translated
into English at the command of Queen Margaret. This
was issued in 1474, and was the first book printed in
the English language. In 1475 or 1476 Caxton returned
to England with a fount of types, which he had employed
Mansion to cut and cast for him, and established himself
as a printer in the precincts of Westminster Abbey.
In 1477 he produced the first book printed in England,
"The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers," followed
by a large number of important works, many of them
written or translated by Caxton himself. Thus was
typography firmly established in England; and Caxton's
immediate successors, Wynken de Worde, Richard
Pynson, William Machlinia, have had a glorious roll of
followers, which has never been broken to this day.
From Westminster the art spread in England to Oxford,
where Theodoricus Rood, from Cologne, printed an
<i>Exposicio Sancti Jeronimi</i> in 1478; and to St. Albans in
1480 by a printer who has never been identified, and
who produced the famous "Chronicle" and "Boke
of St. Albans."</p>

<p>The invasion, we see, had been most rapid. In less
than fifteen years, every important city had followed
the movement, and was ready to establish printing
offices. If we may credit a certain controverted document,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Charles VII. had on the 3rd of October, 1458,
sent to Mayence one of the best medal engravers of the
Mint of Tours to study the process of which marvels
were spoken: "The 3rd of October, 1458, the King
having learned that Messire Guthenberg, living at
Mayence, in the country of Germany, a dexterous man
in carving and making letters with a punch, had brought
to light the invention of printing by punches and types,
desirous of inquiring into such a treasure, the King has
commanded the generals of his mints to nominate persons
well instructed in the said cutting and to send
them secretly to the said place to inform themselves of
the said mode and invention, to understand and learn
the art of them, in order to satisfy the said Lord
King; and it was undertaken by Nicholas Jenson, who
took the said journey to bring intelligence of the said
art and of the execution of it in the said kingdom,
which first has made known the said art of impression
to the said kingdom of France" (Biblioth&egrave;que de
l'Arsenal, Hf 467, pp. 410, 411).</p>

<p>Nicholas Jenson on his return met with a cool reception
from Louis XI., who did not continue the works
of his father. It may be supposed that this coolness
was the cause of his expatriating himself and retiring
to a place where his industry could be better exercised.
Ten years after the above mission we find him established
at Venice, his art of engraver of letters joined
to that of printer. His Eusebius, translated by Trapezuntius,
and his Justinian, were composed in 1470 with
such marvellous and clear types that from that day the
best typographers have imitated his founts. In spite
of its success, he did not confine himself to these letters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
but he made use also of Gothic, in which he printed
by preference pious books.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

  </a>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Imprint of Nicholas Jenson to a Justinian,
printed in 1470 at Venice. This type has prevailed up to now.</p>
</div>

<p>In spite of the attempts of Jenson in the name of the
King of France&mdash;that is, if these attempts ever took
place in the manner indicated above&mdash;the invention was
not known to have commended itself to the powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
university of Paris. In general, and especially for the
introduction of innovations in that learned body, it was
necessary to fight, to strike without much chance of
success, save in case of having acquaintance in the
place. We have seen John Fust, obliged suddenly
to retake the road to Germany, in a fair way to find
himself taxed with sorcery, not an inconsiderable
matter. For others the sale of unauthorised books had
had most unhappy consequences unless the Parliament
intervened. So ten years had passed since the journey
of Jenson, and ten or twelve since the first manifestations
of typography at Mayence, without the diabolical
discovery finding admittance to the Sorbonne. A still
more extraordinary thing, a Cologne printer issued
about 1472 a small folio in Gothic type, thirty-one
long lines to a page, which was a work written in
French. The <i>Histoires de Troyes</i> of Raoul Le Fevre,
chaplain of the dukes of Burgundy, first found a
publisher in Germany, and soon after another in
England, before a single press was definitely installed
at Paris.</p>

<p>As we have said of Peter Schoeffer, numerous
German students were in the university, where they
pursued their studies, and frequently remained later as
masters. It has been found that in 1458 a former
student of Leipzig named John Heinlein, a native of
Stein, in the diocese of Spire, entered as regent of the
college of Burgundy, from whence he passed to the
Sorbonne in 1462, the year of the troubles in Mayence.
After the manner of latinising names so common at
that time, he called himself Lapidanus, from the name
of his native place, which means Stone in German.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Heinlein met in Paris a Savoyard, William Fichet,
born in 1433 at Petit Bornand, who became an associate
of the Sorbonne about 1461, and finally rector in 1468.
These two men were great friends, and their particular
instincts attracted them to men of elevated studies. They
divined at once the enormous help printing would bring
to their work. Besides, it grieved them to see through
the whole of France, especially in Touraine, German
colporteurs carrying on their trade under cover of other
commerce, a practice from which the most grave inconveniences
might result. It occurred to them that to
prevent fraud they would themselves create a printing
establishment; but if they deliberated on it, it must
have been in secret, for the registers of the Sorbonne
are silent on their enterprise. If Fichet conceived the
idea, it may be believed that, from his German origin,
Heinlein put it into execution. M. Philippe thinks that
he was formerly at Basle. In all probability it was from
that city he tried to obtain his workmen. In 1468 six
years had elapsed since the craftsmen were dispersed
and fled from Mayence. At all events, it was from
Basle that Ulrich Gering, Michael Freyburger, and
Martin Krantz, printers recommended to the two
Sorbonnists, departed, and in due course arrived in
Paris. Of these three men, who were the first to
establish a printing office on the French side of the
Rhine, Ulrich Gering was a student as well as a
printer, so was Freyburger, originally of Colmar.
Krantz was a letter-founder, and the only real workman
of the three companions.</p>

<p>We have often regretted with regard to these men,
as also to Gutenberg, Fust, and Schoeffer, that no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
really authentic portrait has transmitted their features
to us. Every one will recall the fur cap and loose
pantaloons of the mediocre statue at Mayence, but
there is really no portrait of Gutenberg. As to Gering,
M. Philippe, in his <i>Histoire de l'Origine de l'Imprimerie
&agrave; Paris</i>, publishes a grotesque figure muffled in the
ruff of the sixteenth century, after a picture preserved
at Lucerne, but for which much cannot be said.
Lacaille, in his <i>Histoire de l'Imprimerie</i>, gives a full-length
portrait of Gering, said to be taken from a
painting in the College Montagu.</p>

<p>The workshop of the three Germans was set up
within the walls of the Sorbonne&mdash;<i>in &aelig;dibus Sorbonnicis</i>&mdash;in
1469. There they set to work at once, their
printing establishment consisting simply of a room,
none too light, a table, a press, and formes. Krantz
doubtless struck the types chosen by the Sorbonnists,
for there were then in use two sorts of letters: German
Gothic and Roman. They kept to the Roman, as
being more round and clear; and as soon as they
obtained matrices and cast their type, they entered on
their task with ardour.</p>

<p>The tendencies of Fichet and Heinlein were not
towards transcendent theology, but rather towards the
literature of the ancients and contemporary rhetorical
works. Besides, it may be said, considering that men are
far from perfect, Fichet counted on making the authorised
presses serve his own purpose. We find him publishing
a treatise on rhetoric in quarto in 1471; meantime
he supervised the work confided to his artists. They
commenced with a large volume of "Letters" of Gasparin
of Bergamo, which was set up in quarto with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the Roman type, the form of which had been
accepted. At the end of the work, the impression of
which cost much time&mdash;possibly a year&mdash;the three
printers placed a quatrain in Latin distichs, which
is at once a statement of identity and a promise for the
future.</p>

</div>

<p>If we try to apportion to each of the three printers
his share in the making of the book, it may be supposed
that the intellectual part of the composition and the correction
fell to Freyburger and Gering, while the heavier
work of founding, placing in formes, and press work
fell to Krantz. This essay, satisfactory as it appeared,
was far from perfection. The first Parisian printers had
multiplied abbreviations and irregular contractions, and
enormous difficulties and inevitable faults ensued.
Further, either they had more than one punch, or the
leaden matrix was deformed, for the characters frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
differ. At the same time, we must commend
them for having used the <i>&aelig;</i> and <i>&oelig;</i>, which were uniformly
written <i>e</i> in the manuscripts, thus giving rise
to errors without number. Their punctuation was the
comma, semicolon, and full stop.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;<i>Rhetorique</i> of Fichet, printed at Paris in

</div>

<p>Fichet and Heinlein had become the modest librarians
of the Sorbonne, and this new employment gave them
greater facilities for surveillance. The printing office
did not remain inactive. It issued successively the
"Orthography" of Gasparin of Bergamo, the "Letters"
of Phalaris, two books of &AElig;neas Sylvius, the "Conspiracy
of Catiline" of Sallust, the "Epitome of Titus
Livius" of Florus, and finally the "Rhetorics" of
William Fichet, which, if we may credit a letter addressed
to Bessarion, was finished in 1471. Following came the
"Letters" of Bessarion, the <i>Elegantia Latin&aelig; Lingu&aelig;</i>
of Valla, the first folio volume from the Sorbonne
presses; and others, thirteen volumes in 1470-71 and
seventeen in 1472.</p>

<p>At the end of 1472 the workshop was somewhat
broken up, Fichet having left for Rome and Heinlein
preaching in Germany. The three printers had
shown by their works that they were in earnest;
besides, they had from the first gratuitously distributed
copies among the nobles, who, being accustomed to
pay highly for manuscripts, did not fail to note the
difference. The associates then resolved to quit the
Sorbonne and create an establishment for themselves;
their patrons being no longer there to sustain them in
case of failure, and in giving up their presses and types
it may be judged that they were not without anxiety
on that point.</p>

<p>Their oldest dated book, the <i>Manipulus Curatorum</i> of
Montrochet, was also the first that they printed in their
new quarters, at the sign of the "Golden Sun" in the
Rue St. Jacques. They remained united up to the
year 1477, when Gering alone printed at the "Golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
Sun," but he obtained associates, George Mainyal in
1480 and Berthold Rembold in 1494, who lived with
him in the Rue de la Sorbonne, where he established
himself on leaving the Rue St. Jacques. Ulrich Gering
died on the 23rd of August, 1510, after a half-century
of work.</p>

<p>The movement inaugurated by the Sorbonne was
promptly followed. German workmen opened their
shops nearly everywhere in France; then the French
themselves scattered. At Lyons in 1472 a Frenchman
was established, the same at Angers, Caen, Metz,
Troyes, Besan&ccedil;on, and Salins. But in the central
provinces we find Henry Mayer at Toulouse, John
Neumeister at Albi; in the east Metlinger at Dijon;
and Michael Wensler, of Basle, at Macon, among
others, about 1493.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at an epoch of greater efforts.
The Lyons printers used ornamental letters, from which
were developed engravings in the Book. Since the
block books illustration had been neglected, as the means
were wanting to distribute the plates here and there
in the forme; Schoeffer still employed initial letters in
wood very like vignettes. John Fust was now dead, but
Peter Schoeffer continued to print without intermission.</p>

<p>If we search for the precise epoch in which illustration
appeared in the history of the Book, we shall
perhaps have to go back to the time of Albert Pfister,
printer of Bamberg, who issued in 1461 an edition of
the "Fables of Ulrich Bohner" with a hundred and
one figures on wood. This may be said to be the
unconscious combination of xylography with typography,
a kind of transformation of old elements to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
new things without other importance; art had no place
in this adaptation.</p>

<p>Up to this time Germany had not, in its school of
painters or miniaturists, men capable of giving a
personal impulse to ornament. In the German editions
of the block books the influence of Van Eyck had
made itself felt very sensibly, and the Flemish had
preserved their supremacy on this point; on the other
hand, the German printers who went to seek their
fortune in Italy fell into the middle of a circle admirably
prepared to receive them and to communicate
their ideas to them. It is believed that the first book
printed in Italy with woodcuts in the text and with an
ascertained date is the work of a German established
at Rome, Ulrich Hahn, in 1467. An account in the
<i>Annuaire du Bibliophile</i>, which, being without citation
of authority, we quote for what it is worth, relates
that Ulrich Hahn was established as a printer at
Vienna about 1462, but was driven thence by the publication
of a pamphlet against the burgomaster of the
city, and was attracted to Rome by Torquemada, who
confided to him the impression of his work the <i>Meditationes</i>.
Hahn was an engraver, as were also most
of his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> at that time&mdash;that is, he cut in relief
designs to be intercalated in the text&mdash;and Passavant
relates that the designs of the <i>Meditationes</i> were from
compositions of Fra Angelico, who died in 1455. Be
that as it may, the book, the printing of which was
finished on St. Sylvester's Day, 1467, is the first known
with engravings, and only three copies of it exist:
one at Vienna, one at Nuremberg, and one in Lord
Spencer's library; it is composed in Gothic type in folio.</p>

principal&mdash;an archer shooting at a butt. Published
in 1472, the volume of Valturius followed soon after
the <i>Meditationes</i>, but the engravings enable us to see
how the Italian process, consisting mostly of lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
without shadows, differed from the Dutch and German.
One thing to be remarked here is the purity of the
design, in spite of the roughness of the engraving; we
see in these figures Italian art at its height, despite the
somewhat coarse translation of the wood-cutter.</p>

<p>At Venice the German inventors had reaped their
harvest. At the end of the fifteenth century, fifty years
after the invention of typography, the printing offices
and booksellers' shops were counted by hundreds.
It was in this city that for the first time a title with
frontispiece carrying indication of the contents, the
place, the date, and the name of the printer, was given
to the Book. We give here this ornamental title,
placed before a <i>Calendario</i> of John de Monteregio,
printed by Pictor, Loslein, and Ratdolt in 1476, folio.</p>

<p>The German Erhardt Ratdolt was probably the promoter
of these innovations. He soon afterwards published
the first geometrical book with figures, the
"Elements of Euclid," 1482, folio; in the same year
he produced the <i>Poeticon Astronomicum</i> of Hyginus,
previously printed at Ferrara, with illustrations on wood
of excellent design, but laboriously and unskilfully
engraved. Yet the art of the Book could not remain
mediocre in this city, where the artists were creating
marvels. John of Spire and afterwards Nicholas Jenson,
the emigrant from France, of whom we have spoken
above, had created, after Italian manuscripts, that Roman
letter, the primitive type of which has come down to our
time very little retouched. At the death of Jenson in
1481, his materials passed into the hands of Andrew
d'Asola, called Andrea Torresani, who did not allow the
good traditions of his master to die, and who produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
among others a book bearing signatures, catchwords,
and paging ("Letters of St. Jerome," 1488). Torresani
was the father-in-law of Aldus Manutius, who was to be
for ever illustrious in the art of printing at Venice,
and raised his art to the highest perfection.</p>

</div>

<p>But if decoration by means of relief blocks found
a favourable reception in Italy and, above all, a group
of artists capable of carrying it to success, there were
at the same time other experiments conceived in
a different way. The discovery of Maso Finiguerra
gave to the art a new process of reproduction, and
printing presses had now to render possible and practicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the working of engraved plates. In order to make
that which follows comprehensible, we enter into a few
technical details, the whole subject having been so
admirably and fully treated by MM. Delaborde and
Duplessis.</p>

<p>In the engraved wood block, as in the printing type,
it is a projection in the wood or metal which, being
inked and passed under a press, leaves on paper its
lines in black. Naturally then the intercalation of an
engraving of this kind in typographical composition is
made without difficulty, and the impression of both is
taken at once. On the other hand, a line engraving is
obtained from incised lines on a plate of copper; that is,
an instrument called a burin traces the lines, which are
filled with greasy ink. These incised lines only are
inked. The surface of the plate is cleaned off to avoid
smudging. The sheet of paper destined for the impression
has then to be made very pliable, so that at
the striking of the press it runs, so to speak, to find the
ink in the lines and hold it. It is therefore impossible
to take a text from relief characters at the same time
as an engraved plate.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 15.&mdash;Engraving on metal by Baccio Baldini for <i>El
Monte Santo di Dio</i>, in 1477.</p>
</div>

<p>However, this kind of reproduction, which, contrary
to that from wood, allowed of half-tints or toning down,
attracted in good time the workers at the Book. It
appeared to them possible to reconcile the two printings
by the successive passage of the same sheet of paper
through the press, to receive at first the impression
from the type and afterwards to find the ink deposited
in the incisions in the copper. The first manifestation
of this new method of illustration was made at
Florence, the home of line engraving, by Nicholas di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Lorenzo in 1477, for the work of Antonio Bettini, of
Siena, called <i>El Monte Santo di Dio</i>. Here the artists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
were never known. Common opinion has it that
Baccio Baldini borrowed from Sandro Botticelli the
subjects of his plates. Italian engraving always seeks
its source in Pollajuolo, Botticelli, and Baldini. It
is not the simple work of a niellist, but it had not
yet reached perfection either in the work or in the
impression; the illustrations of the <i>Monte Santo</i> are
proof of this, as are also those of the <i>Dante</i>, by Baldini,
in 1481, for the same Nicholas di Lorenzo. From this
we reproduce the Misers.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Metal engraving by Baccio Baldini from the

</div>

<p>At this epoch engravings from the burin were taken
with a pale ink, the composition of which is very
different from the fine black ink of Schoeffer as well
as of the old Italian printers. And besides in most
cases the proofs were obtained with the <i>frotton</i>, like
the ancient block books, an eminently defective process.
The press was not yet well adapted to the delicate
work of line engraving, and the workmen, who did not
apply the plates until after the text was printed, preferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
not to risk the loss of their sheets by the use
of inappropriate presses. These, with the insignificant
attempts made by the Germans in 1479,
<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> are the
beginnings of the process of line engraving in the
ornamentation of the Book. In fact, the process failed
to take its due position for want of a more convenient
mode of working. Relief engraving had got
ahead; with it the sheets used for the impression
did not require working more than once to register
the figures with the text; in a word, the labour
was not so great. A century had to pass before line
engraving completely dethroned the vignette on wood,
a century in which the latter attained its height, and
showed what able artisans could make of a process
apparently the least flexible.</p>

<p>Not to leave Italy, which had the honour of making
the book with engraved illustrations known to the world,
we pass by some years, during which Arnold Bucking
gave at Rome a <i>Cosmographia</i> of Ptolemy, 1478, with
incised plates, which is the first printed atlas that was
produced, whilst as regards ordinary publications there
appeared in all parts classical and Italian works, such
as Cicero, Virgil, Tacitus, Pliny, Eusebius, among the
ancients, and Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, etc., among
moderns. Among the editions of Dante, we may cite
that of Peter of Cremona, dated 18th November, 1491,
with one engraving to each canto, of which the earlier
are after Botticelli, and perhaps drawn by him directly
on the wood. Passavant believes these figures to be
cut in relief in the metal. On some of the plates there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
is a signature, a Gothic <b>b</b>, the signification of which
leaves a free field for conjecture, and perhaps for
error. Copies of this book with the complete series of
twenty plates are extremely rare; one in the Hamilton
Palace Library sold in May, 1884, for &pound;380; the
Royal Library of Berlin recently agreed to pay &pound;1,200
for a proof set of the plates.</p>

<p>As we shall see later apropos of German vignettes
of the same period, the characteristic of Italian engraving
was sobriety, the complete absence of useless work
and the great simplicity of the human figure. This
special manner will be found in the famous edition of
the <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i> of Francis Colonna,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
printed in 1499 by Aldus, copied sixty years later by
a French printer, and lately reproduced in reduced

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The Italian illustrators, whether they were working
in wood, or, as some writers have it, in metal, adroitly
brought their figures forward by contrasting some rudimentary
work in the persons with the more accentuated
and often stippled ground, which formed a dark
background. This was also the ordinary process in
their ornaments, among the most interesting of which
are the borders of the plates to an edition of Dante by
Bonino de Bonini, Brescia, 1487, of which a specimen
is here reproduced.</p>

<p>If we return from Italy, which then took the lead,
to Germany, a school of <i>Formschneiders</i> is found about
the year 1470 at Augsburg, whose secluded workshops
were of no benefit to the booksellers. These
ill-advised artisans went still further. Apparently
furious to see printing so widely spread as to render
their bad woodcuts difficult to get rid of, they united
in a body to interdict Gunther Zainer and Sch&uuml;ssler
from putting engravings into their books. They must
nevertheless have come to an ultimate arrangement,
for Zainer printed in 1477 a book on chess by Jacopo
da Cessole, with vignettes. He was one of the few
German printers who employed Roman characters in
place of the Gothic of Peter Schoeffer. At Cologne
in 1474 Arnold Ther Hoernen published a work entitled
<i>Fasciculus Temporum</i>, with small illustrations
engraved on wood. A Bible without date contains most
interesting illustrations. As to the celebrated <i>Todtentantz</i>,
or "Dance of Death," published about 1485,
it contains forty-one relief plates of the most ordinary
kind, the same as in the "Chronicle of Cologne" of
1499, of which the figures, though less German, less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
distorted, are worth little compared with those of the
Nuremberg books, more German, but more artistic.</p>

</div>

<p>At Nuremberg, Antony Koburger, called by Badius
the prince of booksellers, directed an immense establishment,
employing more than a hundred workmen,
without counting smaller houses at Basle and Lyons.
Koburger was a capable and a fortunate man. He
had at first put forth a Bible very indifferently illustrated
with the cuts of the Cologne Bible, but he had
before him something better than copying others.
Michael Wohlgemuth, born at Nuremberg in 1434,
was then in the full vigour of his talent. To his school
the young Albert D&uuml;rer came to study; and as he was
able to draw on wood as well as to engrave on copper
and paint on panel, Koburger was attracted to him, and
engaged him to make a set of illustrations for a book.
The projected work was the <i>Schatzbehalter</i>, a sort of
ascetic compilation, without interest, without arrangement.
Michael Wohlgemuth set to work; and, thanks
to the ability of his engravers, of whom William Pleydenwurff
was probably one, Koburger was able to put
the book on sale in the course of 1491 in three hundred
and fifty-two folios of two columns. Without being
perfection, the designs of Wohlgemuth, very German,
very striking, present the vigour and merit of the
future school of Nuremberg. The figure is no longer
a simple line, in the manner of the block books, but
a combination of interlaced cuttings, intended to imitate
colour. Those representing the creation of Eve
and the daughter of Jephthah are here reproduced.
In the search for harmony between the text and
engravings of this curious work, we shall find grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and gaiety laid aside, on the other hand a freedom
and boldness that interest and permit us to appreciate
at their value the Nuremberg artists and Koburger,
the printer. In fact, the German artists are more
individual, each one taken by himself, than the Italian
illustrators could be, condemned as they were to
the hierarchical commonplace and to a certain form of
idealism into which the art of Italy entered little by
little. The German painters, naturalists and believers,
presented their heroes in the image of that robust
nature that was before their eyes. It was in this
rude and unpolished spirit that Michael Wohlgemuth
decorated the <i>Schatzbehalter</i>; he also composed the
designs for the "Nuremberg Chronicle" of Dr. Hartman
Schedel, printed by Koburger in 1493.</p>

</div>

<p>With D&uuml;rer, at the latter end of the fifteenth century,
the Book was no more than a pretext for engravings.
Thausing, his biographer, says that the great artist felt
the necessity of designing an Apocalypse at Rome at
the time that Luther was premeditating his religious
revolution in face of the worldly splendours of the
pontifical court. The "Apocalypse," published in 1511
in Latin, with Gothic characters, was an album of
fifteen large wood engravings. The Four Horsemen is
the best of these plates, and the boldest; but in this gross
fancy, in these poor halting old hacks, the fantastic and
grand idea which the artist meant to convey can hardly
be seen. It may be said the genius of D&uuml;rer was little
adapted to vignettes, however large they were, and did
not easily lend itself to the exigencies of a spun-out
subject. The title of his "Apocalypse" is of its kind a
curious example of German genius, but, in spite of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
vigour, it does not please like an Italian headpiece or
like a French or Flemish frontispiece. The other works
of D&uuml;rer published in the fifteenth century, "The Life
of the Virgin" and "The Passion," were also sets
of prints that received a text in the sixteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>For the rest of his illustrations D&uuml;rer belongs to the
sixteenth century, and we shall have occasion to recur
to his works. At present it remains to speak of a
curious work printed at Basle by Bergman de Olpe
in 1497, which appears to be the first comic conception
of fifteenth century artists: the <i>Navis Stultifera</i>, or
"Ship of Fools," of Sebastian Brandt. This work of
the school of Basle lacks neither originality nor vigour.
At the time when it was published its success was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
immense, from the strange tricks of its clowns, with
fools' caps, with which every page was adorned. Alas!
the best things fall under the satire of these jesters,
even the Book and the lover of books, if we may
judge by the sarcasms against useless publications
volleyed by the personage here reproduced. "I have
the first place among fools.... I possess heaps of
volumes that I rarely open. If I read them, I forget
them, and I am no wiser." Brunet sees in these
humorous caricatures more art than is really to be
found in them. Their value is owing more to their
spirit and humour than to any other artistic merit.
Even the engraving is singularly fitted to the subject,
with its peculiar cutting, somewhat executed in hairlines.
The designer was certainly not a Holbein,
but he is no longer the primitive artisan of the first
German plates, and his freedom is not displeasing.</p>

</div>

<p>We have before spoken, apropos of engraving by the
burin in Italy, of the small share of Germany in the
essay at illustration by that means, and we do not see
a real and serious attempt in the two little coats of
arms in copper plate in the <i>Missale Herbipolense</i>,
printed in 1479.</p>

<p>The Flemish had not taken any great flights in
the midst of this almost European movement. The
school of Burgundy, whose influence was felt in all the
surrounding countries, had lost its authority in consequence
of the progress realized at Mayence. Without
doubt the great Flemish artists were there, but they
were honoured painters, and their inclination did not
descend to seeking the booksellers beyond making
them offers of service. Besides, the first of these,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
officially established in Flanders, were two Germans,
John of Westphalia and John Veldener, of Cologne,
who established themselves in the university of Louvain
in 1473, three years after the first Paris printers.
John of Westphalia, who took his own portrait for
his mark, edited the <i>Fasciculus Temporum</i>, a book
which had enormous success in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>At Haarlem, in spite of the block books attributed
to Laurent Coster, illustration was backward. About
1485, a Dutch translation of the <i>Malheurs de Troye</i> of
Le Fevre was put on sale. This French book was
published at Cologne before France possessed the
smallest typographical workshop. At Bruges Colard
Mansion illuminated the cuts of his <i>Metamorphoses</i> of
Ovid in 1484. Simple engraving appeared to him far
remote from manuscripts of which the vogue had
not yet passed away. At Zwoll Peter van Os, the
publisher, cut up and used the xylographic plates of
the <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>, while the master <i>&agrave; la navette</i>, John
of Cologne, an artist in the best sense of the word,
was ornamenting certain popular publications with his
designs. At Utrecht Veldener came from Louvain to
establish a workshop. He published for the second
time a <i>Fasciculus</i> in 1480; he created a style of
decoration with flowers and leaves, which shortly
after developed into the trade of <i>Rahmenschneiders</i>.
Antwerp had attracted Gerard de Leeu from Gouda,
and he produced the romance of <i>Belle Vienne</i>. Schiedam
had an inventive engraver who illustrated an edition of
the <i>Chevalier Delib&eacute;r&eacute;</i> of Oliver de la Marche, in folio,
with Gothic letters, after 1483, as we read in the
colophon:&mdash;</p>

<p>The French language, bright and harmonious, thus
found hospitality in other countries. For many examples
of French books published abroad, we cannot
cite one German work printed in France. Spreading
from the north to the south, typography had from
1490 its two principal centres at Paris and Lyons.
After the success of the three Germans at the
Sorbonne, events took their own course. In 1474
Peter C&aelig;saris and John Stol, two students who
had been instructed by Gering and Krantz, founded
the second establishment in Paris, at the sign of the
"Soufflet Vert;" and they printed classical works.
Ten years later appeared Antony V&eacute;rard, Simon
Vostre, and Pigouchet, the first of whom gave to
French bookselling an impulse that it has not since
lost; but before them Pasquier-Bonhomme published
his <i>Grandes Chroniques</i> in 1476, three volumes folio,
the oldest in date of books printed at Paris in
French.</p>

<p>The French school of illustration was at its most
flourishing point at the end of the fifteenth century, but
solely in miniature and ornamentation by the pencil.
The charming figures of the manuscripts had at this
time a Flemish and naturalistic tendency. The most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
celebrated of the great artists in manuscripts, John
Foucquet, could not deny the source of his talent nor
the influence of the Van Eyck school, yet the touch
remained distinctly personal. He had travelled, and
was not confined to the art circles of a single city, as
were so many of the earliest painters of Flanders. He
had gone through Italy, and from thence he transported
architectural subjects for his curious designs in
the <i>Heures</i> of Etienne Chevalier, now at Frankfort; a
precious fragment of it is preserved in the National
Library of Paris. Side by side with this undoubted
master, whose works are happily known, lived a more
modest artist: John Perr&eacute;al, called John of Paris,
painter to Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Anne of
Brittany.</p>

<p>In joining with these two masters, to serve as a
transition between Foucquet and Perr&eacute;al, John Bourdichon,
designer to the kings of France from Louis XI.
to Francis I., we obtain already a not despicable
assemblage of living forces. Without doubt these men
were not comparable either with the admirable school
of Flanders, or the Germans of Nuremberg, or the
masters of Italy; but, moderate as we may deem their
merit, they did their tasks day by day, painting miniatures,
colouring coats of arms, rendering to the kings,
their masters, all the little duties of devoted servants
without conceit, and preparing, according to their
means, the great artistic movement in France of the
seventeenth century. That these men, leaving the
brush for the pencil, devoted themselves to design
figures on wood, is undeniable. It is said that one
of them followed Charles VIII. to the Italian wars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and probably sketched the battles of the campaign as
they took place. Now in the books published at this
epoch in France we meet with vignettes which so
very nearly approach miniatures, that we can easily
recognise in them French taste and finish. Such are,
for example, the illustrations of the <i>Mer des Histoires</i>,
printed by Le Rouge in 1488, where suppleness of
design is blended in some parts with extraordinary
dexterity in engraving. Nevertheless, others leave
something to be desired; they maim the best subjects by
their unskilful line and their awkwardness of handling.
Were not these engravers on wood printers themselves:
the Commins, Guyot Marchants, Pierre Lecarrons, Jean
Trepperels, and others? We are tempted to see in
certain shapeless work the hasty and light labour of
an artisan hurried in its execution. As mentioned
above, the part taken by the booksellers in the making
of the plates does not make our supposition in itself
appear inadmissible.</p>

<p>Printing had been established about twenty years in
Paris when Philip Pigouchet, printer and engraver on
wood, began to exercise his trade for himself or on
account of other publishers. Formerly bookseller in
the University, he transported his presses to the Rue
de la Harpe, and took for his mark the curious figure
here reproduced. At this moment a veritable merchant,
Simon Vostre, conceived the idea of putting
forth Books of Hours, until then disdained in France,
and of publishing them in fine editions with figures,
borders, ornaments, large separate plates, and all the
resources of typography. The trials made at Venice
and Naples between 1473 and 1476 warranted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
enterprise. Entering into partnership with Pigouchet,
the two were able on the 17th of April, 1488, to place
on sale the <i>Heures &agrave; l'Usaige de Rome</i>, octavo, with
varied ornaments and figures. The operation having
succeeded beyond their hopes, thanks to the combination
of the subjects of the borders, subjects that could
be turned and re-turned in all ways so as to obtain the
greatest variety, Simon Vostre reapplied himself to the
work, and ordered new cuts to augment the number of
his decorations. Passavant's idea is commonly received
that the engraving was in relief on metal; the line
in it is very fine, the background stippled, and the
borders without scratches. Wood could not have resisted
the force of the press; the reliefs would have
been crushed, the borders rubbed and broken. In all
the successive editions hard work and wear are not
remarked, and we are forced to admit the use of a
harder material than the pear or box-wood of ordinary
blocks.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>According to his wants, Simon Vostre designed new
series of ornaments. Among them were histories of the
saints, Biblical figures, even caricatures against Churchmen,
after the manner of the old sculptors, who thought
that sin was rendered more horrible in the garb of
a monk. Then there were the Dance of Death and
sibyls, allying sacred with profane, even the trades, all
forming a medley of little figures in the margins, in
the borders, nestled among acanthus leaves, distorted
men, fantastic animals, and saints piously praying. The
Middle Ages live again in these bright and charming
books, French in their style, imbued with good sense
and perfect toleration.</p>

<p>The Book rose under Simon Vostre and Philip
Pigouchet to the culminating point of ornamentation.
Here design and engraving improve and sustain each
other. It is not only the stippled backgrounds of the
borders that please the eye. And who was this unknown
designer, this painter of bold conceptions, whose
work is complete in little nothings? However, the
large full-page figures have not always an originality
of their own, nor the French touch of the borders.
Thus that of the Passion here reproduced is inspired
line for line by the German, Martin Schongauer. Are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
we to suppose, that duplicates of blocks passed between
France and Germany, or was a copy made by
a French designer? It is difficult to say. Still the
coincidence is not common to all the missals of the
great Parisian bookseller. The Death of the Virgin
here reproduced is an evident proof of it. It forms part
of the 1488 book, and is a truly French work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>It may be said that from the artistic association of
Philip Pigouchet and Simon Vostre was born the art of
illustration of the Book in France; they worked
together for eighteen years, in steady collaboration, and,
as far as we know, without a cloud. At Vostre's commencement
in 1488 he lived in the Rue Neuve Notre
Dame, at the sign of "St. Jean l'Evangeliste;" and in
1520 he was still there, having published more than
three hundred editions of the Missal, according to the
use of the several cities.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Simon Vostre, another publisher
was giving a singular impulse to the Book by his
extreme energy, true taste, and the aid of first-class
artists. Antony Verard, the most illustrious of the old
French booksellers, was a writer, printer, illuminator,
and dealer. Born in the second half of the fifteenth
century, he established himself in Paris on the Pont
Notre Dame, both sides of which were then covered
with shops, and about 1485 commenced his fine
editions with a "Decameron" in French by Laurent de
Premierfait. M. Renouvier remarks in his notice of
Verard that his first books were not good, the plates
were often unskilful, and were probably borrowed or
bought from others; this may be very well understood
in a beginner whose modest resources did not permit
bold enterprises; the figures were in most cases
groundworks for miniatures, outlines and sketches rather
than vignettes.</p>

</div>

<p>Antony Verard was accustomed to take a certain
number of fine copies on vellum or paper of each book
published by him, in
which authorised painters
added miniatures and
ornaments. It is curious
now to find what the cost
to one of the great lords
of the court of Charles
VIII. was of one of these
special copies in all the
details of its impression,
and we find it in a document
published by M.
Senemaud in a provincial
journal (<i>Bulletin de la
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Arch&eacute;ologique de la
Charente</i>, 1859, part 2,
p. 91), which enables
us at the same time to
penetrate into a printing office of a great French publisher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of the fifteenth century. According to this document,
Verard did not disdain to put his own hand to the work,
even to carrying the book to the house of his patron
if he were a man of consequence. It is an account of
Charles de Valois-Angoul&ecirc;me, father of Francis I. He
was then living at Cognac; and he ordered Verard to
print separately for him on vellum the romance of Tristan,
the "Book of Consolation" of Boetius, the <i>Ordinaire du
Chr&eacute;tien</i>, and <i>Heures en Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, each with illuminations
and binding. In the detail of expenses Verard
omits nothing. He reckons the parchment at three
sous four deniers the sheet, the painted and illuminated
figures at one &eacute;cu the large and five sols the small. We
give here the outline of one of the plates of the Tristan,
ordered by the Duc d'Angoul&ecirc;me, reduced by two-thirds,
and from it it may be judged that the profession
of the illuminator, even for the time, was by no means
brilliant. The binding was in dark-coloured velvet, with
two clasps with the arms of the Duke, which cost sixty
sous each. The work finished, Verard took the route
for Cognac, carrying the precious volumes. He was
allowed twenty livres for carriage; and this brings the
total to 207 livres 10 sous, equivalent to &pound;200 to &pound;240
of present money.</p>

</div>

<p>Verard had preceded Simon Vostre in the publication
of books of hours, but his first volume dated
1487 was not successful for the want of borders and
frontispieces. At the most he had introduced figures intended
for illumination, which, as well as the vignettes,
were cut in wood. In 1488, the same year that Simon
Vostre commenced his publications, Verard put forth,
by "command of the King our lord," the book called
the <i>Grandes Heures</i>, which is in quarto, Gothic letter,
without paging, twenty lines to the full page. This
<i>Grandes Heures</i> contained fourteen engravings, large
borders in four compartments, smaller subjects and
initials rubricated by hand. He also published more
than two hundred editions between 1487 and 1513,
and among them the <i>Myst&egrave;re de la Passion</i>, with eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
figures; the <i>Grandes Chroniques</i>, in three folio
volumes, printed by John Maurand; the <i>Bataille
Juda&iuml;que</i> of Flavius Josephus; the <i>Legende Dor&eacute;e</i>
of Voragine, all books for which he called to his aid
rubricators, illuminators, and miniaturists. From the
first he had two shops where he put his productions
on sale: one on the Pont Notre Dame, the other at the
Palace of Justice, "au premier pilier devant la chapelle
o&ugrave; l'on chante la messe de messeigneurs les pr&eacute;sidents."
From 1499, when the Pont Notre Dame was
burned, Verard transported his books to the Carrefour
St. Severin. At his death in 1513 he was living in the Rue
Neuve Notre Dame, "devant Nostre-Dame de Paris."</p>

<p>Besides Verard, Vostre, and Pigouchet, many others
will be found who imitated them in the publication of
books of hours. The first was John du Pr&eacute;, who
published a Paris missal in 1481, and who was at once
printer and bookseller. Like Pigouchet, Du Pr&eacute; printed
books of hours on account of provincial publishers,
without dreaming of the competition he was creating
for himself. The encroachments of the publishers upon
one another, the friendly exchanges, the loans of
plates and type, form one of the most curious parts of
the study of the Book. Thielman Kerver, a German,
also began to put forth books of hours in 1497 in Paris,
ornamenting them with borders and figures on wood,
and modelling his work completely upon that of Simon
Vostre. But after having imitated him, he was associated
with him in the publication and sale of the Paris
Missal; the competition of these men was evidently an
honest one, or the sale of pious works was sufficient to
maintain all engaged in it. Established on the Pont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
St. Michel, at the sign of the "Unicorn," he sold his
stock to Gilles Remacle about the beginning of the
sixteenth century.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Thielman Kerver in his own works shows himself as
the rival of Simon Vostre. The Hardouins, who followed
the same profession, do not appear to have attained the
success of their predecessors; and, excepting in the
<i>Heures &agrave; l'Usage de Rome</i>, published in 1503 by Gilles
Hardouin on the Pont au Change, at the sign of the
"Rose," they servilely imitated them. There was also
among the disciples of Vostre William Eustache, bookseller
to the King, "tenant la boutique dedans la grant
salle du palais du cost&eacute; de messeigneurs les pr&eacute;sidens,
ou sur les grans degr&eacute;s du cost&eacute; de la conciergerie &agrave;
l'ymage St. Jean levangeliste." Eustache made use of
the work of Pigouchet and Kerver, not to mention the
printers of the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>We have named the principal, the fortunate ones;
but what becomes of the crowd of other publishers
whose hopes vanished before the success of Vostre
and Verard? There were Denis Meslier, with his quarto
<i>Heures de Bourges</i>, and Vincent Commin, bookseller of
the Rue Neuve Notre Dame, who thus appealed to his
customers:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There were also Robin Chaillot, Laurent Philippe, and
a hundred others whose names have died with them
or are only preserved on the torn pages of their works.</p>

</div>

<p>But if books of this kind found vogue and a large
sale at this epoch, the dealers did not keep to pious publications
only. By a singular mixture of the sacred and
the profane, the bookmen put on sale on their stalls the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
"Decameron" of Boccaccio as well as the "Hours of the
Immaculate Virgin," and the purchasers thought fit to
make the acquaintance of the one as well as the other.
Besides, the end of the fifteenth century had its literary
preferences, its alluring titles, its attractive frontispieces.
At the commencement of the present century double
titles&mdash;"Atala; or, The Child of Mystery;" "Waverley;
or, Sixty Years Since"&mdash;were common, although now
out of fashion. Since then came books of travels&mdash;<i>Voyages
au Pays des Milliards</i>, etc. In the fifteenth
century, and even since the fourteenth, a series of titles
was in public favour. There was first the <i>D&eacute;bats</i>,
or "Dialogues:" <i>D&eacute;bat de la Dame et de l'Escuyer</i>,
Paris, 1490, folio; "Dialogue of Dives and Pauper," London,
Richard Pynson, 1493; and many other eccentric
titles. There came also thousands of <i>complaintes</i>,
a kind of lay in verse or prose; <i>blasons</i>, light pieces describing
this or that thing; <i>doctrinals</i>, that had nothing
to do with doctrine. And among the most approved
subjects, between the piety of some and the gaiety of
others, the Dances of Death established themselves
firmly, showing, according to the hierarchy of classes
then prevalent, Death taking the great ones of the earth,
torturing equally pope, emperor, constable, or minstrel,
grimacing before youth, majesty, and love. Long
before printing appeared, the Dances of Death took
the lead; they were some consolation for the wretched
against their powerful masters, the revenge of the
rabble against the king; they may be seen painted,
sculptured, illuminated, when engraving was not there
to multiply their use; they may be seen largely displayed
on walls, sombre, frightful, at Dresden, Leipzig,
Erfurt, Berne, Lucerne, Rouen, Amiens, and Chaise-Dieu.
It was the great human equality, attempted first
by the French, then by the inimitable Holbein.</p>

Pope and the Emperor.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>We can imagine the impression these bitter ironies
made on the oppressed and disdained lower classes. The
first "Dance of Death" was produced by Guyot Marchant
in 1485, in ten leaves and seventeen engravings,
in folio, with Gothic characters. Marchant describes
himself as "demeurant en Champ Gaillart &agrave; Paris le
vingt-huitiesme jour de septembre mil quatre cent
quatre-vingtz et cinq." The book must have gone off
rapidly, for it was republished in the following year,
with additions and new engravings. French illustration
was already moving forward, as may be judged
by the reproductions here given from the folio edition
of 1486. Pope and emperor, glory and power, are led
and plagued by Death, hideous Death, with open body
and frightful grin.</p>

<p>We could wish that the tendencies and processes
of what may be called the second generation of printers
were well understood. In a few years they surmounted
the difficulties of their art, and made the Book a model
of elegance and simplicity. The smallest details were
cared for, and things apparently the most insignificant
were studied and rendered practical. Speaking of titles,
an enormous progress was here made in the publications
of the end of the century. In Italy the subjects of
decoration ordinarily formed a framework for the front
page, wherein were included useful indications. The
most ancient specimen of this kind has already been
referred to. A model of this species is the "St. Jerome,"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
published at Ferrara by Lorenzo Rossi, of Valenza, in
1497, folio; the title, much adorned, is in Gothic letters;
the engraved initial is very adroitly left in outline, so as
not to burden or break the text.</p>

<p>In Germany there was already the appearance of bad
taste and prodigality, the letters crossing each other,
the Gothic type
covered with bizarre
appendices,
the titles intricate;
later they
became illegible
even for the Germans.</p>

  </a>
<p class="caption">Fig. 34.&mdash;Typographical mark of Thielman Kerver.</p>
</div>

<p>In France the
first page gave
the most circumstantial
indications
of the contents
of the work,
the name and
abode of the
printer and bookseller.
Often
these titles were
ornamented with
movable frameworks, printed in Gothic, sometimes in two
colours, which necessitated two printings, one for the
black and one for the red ink. The mark of the printer
or publisher generally appeared, and it was nearly always
a charming work. These French marks were all more
or less treated heraldically; that is to say, the initials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
occupy a shield, sustained by supporters and cut with extreme
care. The first was that of Fust and Schoeffer at
Mayence, of admirable simplicity and grace. In France
this early specimen of the trade mark took with Simon
Vostre and Verard the shape of delicate illustrations,
finely designed and carefully engraved; but the custom
of allusive marks did not prevail, as we shall have
occasion to see, until the sixteenth century. The mark
of Pigouchet has already been given; that of Thielman
Kerver is conceived in the same principles of taste and
art. The sign of his house being the "Unicorn," Kerver
took as supporters to his shield two unicorns <i>affront&eacute;es</i>.</p>

<p>In these colophons are found philosophic aphorisms,
satirical remarks, marvels of poetry. A certain bookseller
paid court to the powerful university, which
dispensed glory and riches to the poor tradesmen by
buying many books. Andrew Bocard engraved on his
mark this flattery as a border:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="iquot">"Honneur au Roy et &agrave; la court,</div>

<div>Dont nostre bien proc&egrave;de et sourt.</div>
<div>Dieu gart de Paris la cit&eacute;!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Germans introduced into their colophons some
vainglorious notices. Arnold Ther Hoernen, already
mentioned, who printed the <i>Theutonista</i> at Cologne in
1477, boasted in it of having corrected it all with his
own hands. Jean Treschel, established at Lyons in
1493, proclaims himself a German, because the Germans
were the inventors of an art that he himself possessed
to an eminent degree. He prided himself on being what
we may call a skilled typographer; "virum hujus artis
solertissimum," he writes without false modesty. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
times, in the colophons of his books, he attempted Latin
verse, the Sapphic verse of Horace, of a playful turn,
to say that his work was perfected in 1494.</p>

</div>

<p>The portrait is another element of illustration, the
figure of the author prefixed to his work. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
already been a custom in the manuscripts to paint on
the first leaf of the work the likeness of him who composed
it, frequently in the act of presenting his book to
some noble patron; and in this way is often preserved
the only known portrait of either patron or author.
Printing and engraving rendered these effigies more
common, the portraits of one often served for another,
and the booksellers used them without very much scruple.
As we shall see later, this became in the sixteenth
century a means of illustrating a book plainly, but only
at the time when the portrait, drawn or painted, commenced
to be more widely used. Previously the <i>clich&eacute;s</i>
of which we speak went everywhere, from the Italians
to the French, from &AElig;sop to Accursius; these uncertain
physiognomies began with the manuscript romances
of chivalry, from whence they were servilely copied in
typography. From the first the Italians mixed the
ancient and the modern. Thus in a <i>Breviarium</i>, printed
in 1478, there is an engraved portrait of Paul Florentin.
On the same principle, the portrait of Burchiello, an
early Italian poet, was later reproduced in England as
a likeness of William Caxton.</p>

<p>In France the author is often represented writing,
and it was so up to the middle of the sixteenth century.
In an edition of <i>Des Cas des Nobles Hommes</i>, by Jean
Dupr&eacute;, in 1483, Boccaccio is represented seated, having
before him his French translator, Laurent de Premierfait.
This plate is one of the oldest representations of
authors in French books. In the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>,
first edition of Paris and Lyons, in folio, probably
published by William Leroy about 1485, William de
Lorris, the author, is shown in his bed:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is also a portrait of Alain Chartier in his <i>Faits</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
printed in 1489. In the Terence of Treschel, of Lyons,
in 1493, we see a grammarian of the fifteenth century

</div>

<p>While this good work was progressing so nobly in
France, Italy, and Germany, the typographers of England
were by no means idle, although the illustration of the
Book in the fifteenth century was not there so forward.
William Caxton had produced over sixty works, the
colophons of many of them revealing much of the
personal life and character of the first English printer.
Some of them were ornamented with woodcuts; we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
reproduce two from the "Game and Playe of the Chesse,"
printed in folio, about 1476. The first represents a
king and another person playing at chess; the smaller
cut is a representation of the knight, who is thus
described in Caxton's own words: "The knyght ought
to be maad al armed upon an hors in suche wise that
he have an helme on his heed and a spere in his right
hond, and coverid with his shelde, a swerde and a mace
on his left syde, clad with an halberke and plates tofore
his breste, legge harnoys on his legges, spores on his
heelis, on hys handes hys gauntelettes, hys hors wel
broken and taught, and apte to bataylle, and coveryd
with hys armes." The other Caxton block which we
reproduce is a representation of music from the "Mirrour
of the World," a thin folio volume of one hundred leaves
printed in 1481, with thirty-eight woodcuts. These specimens
will serve to show the rudimentary character of
English wood engraving in the fifteenth century. No
authentic portrait of Caxton is known, and the one that
is generally accepted is really a portrait of an Italian
poet, Burchiello, taken from an octavo edition of his
work on Tuscan poetry, printed 1554; this was copied
by Faithorne for Sir Hans Sloane as the portrait of
Caxton, and was reproduced by Ames in his "Typographical
Antiquities," 1749. Lewis prefixed the
portrait here given to his "Life of Mayster Willyam
Caxton," 1737, which is a copy of Faithorne's drawing
with some alterations. John Lettou and William
Machlinia issued various statutes and other legal works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Wynken de Worde continued printing up to 1534,
and issued over four hundred works. He used no less
than nine different marks, all of them bearing Caxton's
initials, evidencing the regard of the pupil for his
master; the mark which we reproduce is one of rare
occurrence. Richard Pynson began in 1493, and continued
well into the sixteenth century, and was one of
the first of the "privileged" printers, authorised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
issue the legal and parliamentary publications. One
of the marks used by him is here reproduced. Julian
Notary began in 1498. The only style of illustration
used by any of these early printers was the woodcut, and
of this there was very little beyond the title-page and
printer's mark. The artistic form of the Book originated
on the Continent, but England was not slow to
adopt it and fashion it to her own ends.</p>

<p>Thus was printing spread abroad, carrying with it to
the countries where it was established the rules of an
unchangeable principle; but, according to its surroundings,
it was so transformed in a few years that its origin
was no longer recognised. It was light in Italy,

the form of illustration a short time after its first and
fruitful essays. The Gothic character, generally used
in Germany, continued in France with the Vostres, the
Verards, and others up to the middle of the sixteenth
century, although the first artisans before this used
Roman type; it was also the prevailing type used in
English books. In Italy it was Jenson, a Frenchman,
who gave to the matrix the alphabet preserved to the
present time; and it was the Venetians and Florentines
who learned before all others the art of judicious
ornamentation of the Book. The French came very
near perfection, thanks to their printers and booksellers,
at the end of the century; and the Germans found
illustrious artists to scatter their compositions in their
large, heavy works.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1">OUR simple division into chapters
will be understood without difficulty
as not corresponding exactly
with the most momentous epochs
in the history of the Book in
France and abroad. Doubtless
it would be easy for France
alone to find some limits and to furnish scholastic
formul&aelig; by which contemporary publishers might be
grouped. But in order to present, as in a synoptical
table, an essential and abridged sketch of the Book
in all European countries, it appeared to us more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
convenient to begin with the confused and tangled
notions by centuries and to unfold in our review the
characteristic facts of each country conjointly. Moreover,
after the sixteenth century neither Italy nor Germany
could compare with France, which, less fortunate,
perhaps, at the beginning than her neighbours, surpassed
them in all the pride of her genius.</p>

<p>The commencement of the sixteenth century found
the French army in Italy, under the command of
Louis XII. Marching from glory to glory, the French
successively saw Pisa, Capua, and Naples, and that
which has since been called the Renaissance displayed
itself little by little to the conquerors. At
Venice was living Aldus Pius Manutius, then the
greatest printer of the entire world. Aldus was
proprietor of the celebrated printing office of Nicholas
Jenson, through his father-in-law, Andrea Torresani, of
Asola, who acquired it on the death of the French
printer; and he had in a few years reached a position
in which he was without a rival. We have seen that
he composed, at the end of the fifteenth century, the
admirable volume <i>Hypnerotomachia</i>, the renown of which
became universal. Aldus was fifty-two years of age,
having been born in 1447; and his learning was increased
by daily intercourse with learned Italians,
among them the celebrated Pico de la Mirandola. His
establishment at Venice in 1488 had for its object the
creation of a chair in Greek, in which language he was
well instructed from his youth. Occupied with the
idea of issuing editions of the principal Greek writers,
which up to then remained in manuscript, he engaged
himself in the formation of a printing office. He first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
published the <i>Herone et Leandro</i> of Mus&aelig;us in 1494,
quarto, in a Greek character apparently designed by
him, and perhaps engraved by Francisco da Bologna;
then the Greek grammar of Constantine Lascaris, with
the date of 1494; and the works of Aristotle in five
folio volumes. At the time of the Italian wars Aldus
was making a revolution in typography, by producing
more practical sizes
and finer characters,
which would permit a
volume of the smallest
height to contain the
matter of a folio printed
with large type. Legend
says that the new
letters were copied
exactly from the handwriting
of Petrarch,
inclining like all cursive
writing; the name
of <i>Italic</i> was given to
this character, which
was also called <i>Aldine</i>,
from its inventor. It was engraved by Francisco da
Bologna. Aldus published in octavo size, with this
kind of letter, an edition of Virgil in 1501, then a
Horace, a Juvenal, a Martial, and a Petrarch in the
same year. The following year, 1502, he gave an
edition of the <i>Terze Rime</i> of Dante, and for the first
time took as his typographical mark an anchor encircled
by a dolphin.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Tory in his <i>Champfleury</i> explains thus the mark of Aldus and his
device, which was in Greek the "Make haste slowly" of Boileau: "The
anchor signifies tardiness, and the dolphin haste, which is to say that
in his business he was moderate."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>His marriage with the daughter of Andrea Torresani,
of Asola, brought together into his possession two printing
houses. The burden became too heavy for Manutius
to think henceforth of publishing by himself. Besides,
the wars did not allow him any repose, of which he
bitterly complained in his prefaces. He attracted
learned Greek scholars, who supervised, each one in
his specialty, the works in progress, and founded a
society, an Aldine academy, in which the greatest names
of the epoch were united. Aldus conveys the perfect
idea of a great printer of those times, doing honour to
celebrated men, in spite of business preoccupations and
of the annoyance caused by the war. It is said that
Erasmus, passing through Venice, called on him, and
not making himself known, was badly received by the
powerful printer. All at once, at the name of the distinguished
visitor, Aldus, overwhelmed for an instant,
rose in great haste and showed him how highly he
appreciated men of letters.</p>

<p>The war finished by ruining this state of affairs. In
1505 Aldus quitted Venice to travel, and on his return
found it poorer than when he went away. Andrea
d'Asola, his father-in-law, came to his aid; but the
great printer had received his death-blow; and in spite
of the activity which he brought to the new establishment,
he further declined until 1515, when he expired,
leaving an inextricable confusion to his son Paul.</p>

<p>He had early abandoned illustration for the scientific
and useful in his publications; besides, the size of book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
chosen by him did not admit of plates; but other
publishers employed artists in the ornamentation of the
Book. Lucantonio Giunta, the most celebrated among
them, was printer and engraver, a striking example
of the affinity of the two trades from their origin.
In 1508 Lucantonio Zonta, as he then spelt his name,
published a Roman breviary in large quarto, with twelve
engravings in the Lombardo-Venetian
manner,
signed "L. A.," in very
good style. The same
artist-publisher cut a
portrait of Virgil for an
edition of that poet about
1515. Furthermore,
Giunta did not alone illustrate
the book from
his own office. Other
designers lent him their
assistance. We find
evidence of this in the
Bible printed by him
in 1519 in small
octavo.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 43.&mdash;Mark of Lucantonio Giunta, of Venice.</p>
</div>

<p>The most meritorious of the artists of Venice at this
time was John Andrea, known as Guadagnino. He
designed the vignettes for Florus's epitome of Livy,
printed at Venice for Melchior Sessa and Peter of
Ravenna (1520, folio); in 1516 he copied the plates of
D&uuml;rer's <i>Apocalypse</i> for that of Alexander Paganini, of
Venice. A Venetian work which signalised the beginning
of the sixteenth century was the <i>Trionfo di Fortuna</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of Sigismond Fanti, of Ferrara, printed by Agostino da
Portese in 1527.</p>

<p>Venice was the home of Titian, and at the present
time the great artist was at the height of his glory.
In 1518 two brothers, Nicholas and Dominic dal Ges&ugrave;,
published a translation of the celebrated "Golden
Legend" of Voragine. The plates which were added to
the work were manifestly inspired by the school of the
Venetian master. Unhappily the engravers have not
always equalled the genius of the drawings.</p>

<p>To resume, the city of Venice was, at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, one of the most prolific in
publishers and artists of talent. Since the first establishments
of the Germans, typography had successively
employed in Venice Nicholas Jenson, a Frenchman,
inventor of the Roman character; Erhard Ratdolt, the
first to employ illustration there; and Aldus Manutius,
scholar and printer, whose progress in printing elevated
that art to the highest rank among human discoveries;
there were also remarkable engravers and draughtsmen,
among others Guadagnino and Giunta, besides the
anonymous masters of the school of Titian. The part
of Venice in the movement, then, was great, but it may
be explained by the riches of its citizens, the extent of
its commerce, and the genius it possessed.</p>

<p>If we now return from Venice to the north, to Milan,
the school of Leonardo da Vinci will make itself apparent
in the Book. In order of date we will mention
the <i>Mysterii Gesta Beat&aelig; Veronic&aelig; Virginis</i>, published
by Gotardo de Ponte 1518, small quarto, with figures
in the style of Luini, and Vitruvius in Italian by Cesariano.
On the testimony of the author, the wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
engravings in a book of Fra Luca Pacioli, <i>De Divina
Proportione</i>, are attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.
M. Delaborde does not believe this, but M. Passavant
does.</p>

<p>In Germany, Nuremberg continued, with Albert
D&uuml;rer and the artists of his school, to furnish book
illustrations at the beginning of the century. The
master reprinted his valuable engravings of the "Life of
the Virgin" in 1511, and also the "Apocalypse." But
after him the art commenced to decline; a hundred years
later nothing remained of the honour and glory gained
by Germany in the commencement. Among the most
interesting of the Nuremberg publications is a chivalric
poem by Melchior Pfinzfing, composed for the marriage
of Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy. As M. Delaborde
in his <i>D&eacute;buts de I'Imprimerie</i> well remarks,
this is not a book destined for sale by a bookseller;
it is a work of art destined by an emperor for his
friends, and he saw that it was an unapproachable work.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 45.&mdash;Plate taken from the <i>Theuerdanck</i>,

Schäufelein.</p>
</div>

<p>Bold strokes, majestic letters, intertwined ornaments,
are here multiplied. Three persons worked upon it for
five years; these were, Peutinger says, Hans Leonard
Sch&auml;ufelein, the painter, Jost Necker, the engraver,
and Sch&ouml;nsperger, the printer of Augsburg, who quitted
his native city for Nuremberg. When they were able to
take a proof, craftsmen were unwilling to believe it to
be a book composed in movable characters; they were
sure, on the contrary, that it was a true xylograph, cut
in wood; and, in fact, from the title here reproduced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the error was excusable. This work, which is now
called the <i>Theuerdanck</i>, from the name of the hero of the
romance, is ornamented with a number of wood engravings,
numbered by Arabic figures. We reproduce one of
the last plates, in which Theuerdanck&mdash;Maximilian&mdash;is
introduced to the Queen&mdash;Mary of Burgundy. The
designs of Sch&auml;ufelein recall very nearly the work of
Albert D&uuml;rer, his master; but, as we said of him, these
works, heavy and dull, although very clever, do not
always suit as vignettes. Again, our criticism does
not extend so much to the <i>Theuerdanck</i>, whose letters,
excessively ornamented and much flattened, furnish
a framework more suitable for the engravings than
would a more slender character, which would be completely
overshadowed by the German plate.</p>

<p>When we have mentioned the <i>Passional Christi</i> of
Lucas Cranach, published by J. Gr&uuml;nenberg at
Wittemberg in 1521&mdash;twenty-six mediocre wood engravings&mdash;we
shall have cited the most important of the
interesting and rare volumes published in Germany at
the commencement of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The Netherlands, Spain, and England were working,
but without great success. In the Low Countries
Plantin and his gigantic enterprises may be recalled.
In Spain the taste had not yet developed itself; and
although the drawing of illustrations may be careful
enough, the wood-cutting is pitiable. We will mention
the Seneca of Toledo in 1510, and the "Chronicle of
Aragon" in 1523. Of England we will speak later.</p>

<p>In France, on the contrary, we find an enormous
commerce in books at the commencement of the sixteenth
century. All the publishers mentioned in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
preceding chapter were still living, and they were
feeling the effects of the French conquests in Italy.
The dithyrambic literature then inaugurated, and which
had its origin under Louis XII., exercised a bad influence
equally upon the printers and decorators of the Book.
Doubtless the composition of the text and engravings
was done hastily, for the great people did not like to
wait for this kind of history. <i>Le Vergier d'Honneur</i>,
written by Octavian de St. Gelais and Andry de la
Vigne, was thus published about the end of the fifteenth
century and ornamented with hasty vignettes, probably
at the expense of Antoine Verard. Upon the accession
to the throne of Louis XII., Claude de Seyssel,
his master of council, composed <i>Les Louenges du Roy
Louis XII.</i>, and soon after translated it from Latin into
French for the same Verard, who printed it in 1508.</p>

<p>The taste for historical works induced the publishers
to produce <i>La Mer des Histoires</i>, which had already
been published in the fifteenth century; Thielman
Kerver put forth the "Compendium" of Robert Gaguin
in 1500 on account of Durand Gerlier and John Petit.
The French version of this work was given in 1514 by
Galliot du Pr&eacute;, with vignettes, and afterwards under
the name of <i>Mirouer Historial</i>, by Renaud Chaudi&egrave;re in
1520, by Nyverd, and others; the same with the
<i>Rozier Historial</i>, with figures, in 1522 and 1528.
Among the most popular works was the <i>Illustrations
de la Gaule et Singularitez de Troye</i>, by John le Maire
de Belges, printed in Paris and ornamented. In 1512
it was published by Geoffroy de Marnef, in 1515 by
John and Gilbert de Marnef, by Regnault, by Philip
le Noir, and others, always in the Gothic characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
which prevailed in France at the beginning of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>We give from the curious book of John le Maire
an interesting woodcut representing Queen Anne
of Brittany as Juno, in which we can without much
difficulty see a remarkable sketch by a Bourdichon or
a Perr&eacute;al. The truly French style of this figure
leaves no doubt as to its origin. At the same time, it
may possibly have been inspired by the Virgin of a
German master, say one of 1466, judging from the
accessories, and even from the pose. This engraving
will be found in the edition of 1512 of Gilbert de
Marnef, in Gothic letter, quarto. On the reverse are
the arms and device of John le Maire de Belges.</p>

<p>The time that elapsed from the death of Louis XI.
until the accession of Francis I.&mdash;that is to say, from
1483 to 1515&mdash;was, to employ an old expression, the
golden age of French printing and illustration. Under
Charles VIII. and Louis XII. the designers on wood
were not yet affected by the neighbouring schools;
neither the accentuated Italian influence nor the
German processes had reached them; they did in their
own way that which came to them, and they did it in
their own fashion and habit, without foreign influence.
Further, the kings did not ignore them, and Louis XII.
preserved to the printers of the university all their
rights and privileges in a magniloquent ordinance,
in which the art of typography was extolled in the
highest terms. It restores to them all the advantages
that they had lost. It recites, "In consideration
of the great benefit that has come to our
kingdom by means of the art and science of printing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
the invention of which seems more Divine than human,
which, thanks to God, has been invented and found in
our time by the help and industry of booksellers, by
which our holy Catholic faith has been greatly augmented
and strengthened, justice better understood and
administered, and Divine service more honourably and
diligently made, said, and celebrated, ... by means
of which our kingdom precedes all others," etc., etc.
(Blois, 9th April, 1513). Certainly Louis made the best
of himself and his kingdom in this preamble, but it must
be recognised that France already held a predominant
rank in the new industry, and that beyond the Italians
she had no fear of serious rivalry. The school of
ornamentists made constant progress. Before the
books of hours, the booksellers contented themselves
with miserable blocks, placed side by side, forming
a framework of good and bad together; but after
Simon Vostre, Verard, and the others they were
singularly refined. The borders, at least in the books
of hours, had become the principal part of the book;
they had in them flowers, architectural, complicated,
and simple subjects, all of perfect taste and extreme
elegance; and, as we have observed in the representation
of Anne of Brittany in the <i>Illustrations de la
Gaule</i>, the figure subjects were no longer mechanical,
commonplace, and tiresome blocks, but, on the contrary,
more often works specially designed and engraved by
artists of merit.</p>

</div>

<p>Geoffroy Tory, born at Bourges in 1480, continued
after Vostre and Verard the onward march of illustration
of the Book. He was a sort of encyclop&aelig;dist,
who knew and foresaw everything, but with a singularly
subtler and finer genius than his predecessors.
There is now very little doubt that at first Tory was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
an engraver and printer. Moreover, he published with
Jean Petit one of his first volumes, the geography
of Pomponius Mela, printed by Gilles de Gourmont
in 1507. Tory was then an erudite and diffusive
commentator. Later he published a book with poor
engravings (<i>Valerii Probi Grammatici Opusculum</i>, 1510),
waiting until his good star should place him on the
right road. He had for his mark, say the bibliographers,
the cross of Lorraine (&#9768;), small enough to be
lost in the ornamentation of his plates. Really this
sign is found in Tory's mark&mdash;the "Pot Cass&eacute;"&mdash;the
broken jar&mdash;and also sometimes in the letter G,
which was his ordinary signature. This opinion,
which we will not try to contradict in a popular work
like this, appears to us to err, as others used this
mark, as may be judged from the essentially different
touches of engravings bearing the cross of Lorraine,
and particularly those of Wo&eacute;riot in the middle of the
century.</p>

<p>If M. A. Bernard<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
may be credited, Geoffroy Tory
cultivated all the sciences with equal success. For
our purpose, suffice it to recognise his right to one
of the first places in the art of decoration of books
of hours. Doubtless his travels in Italy had contributed
to modify his taste and to detach him a little from
the sober and simple manner that then characterised
French engraving; but he nevertheless preserved the
indelible traces of the origin of his art, in the same way
as some people cannot correct their provincial accent.
The <i>Heures de la Vierge</i>, which he designed, and which
he had engraved about 1520, on account of Simon
de Colines, is marvellously surrounded by ornaments,
until then unknown in France; at the same time,
and in spite of other tendencies, it is purely a French
work, and the specimen given here is a convincing proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Geoffroy Tory composed a curious book, as poetic
as learned, in which he studied at once the form of the
letter from the typographic and the emblematic point
of view, and also the French orthography of the time.
He tells us himself that he was brought to commence
this book on the f&ecirc;te-day of the kings, 1523, when,
after a frugal repast, he was, he says, "dreaming on
my bed and revolving my memory, thinking of a
thousand little fancies, serious and mirthful, among
which I thought of some antique letters that I had
made for Monseigneur the treasurer for war, Master
Jehan Grolier, councillor and secretary of our lord
the King, amateur of fine letters and of all learned
personages." Tory called his book <i>Champfleury, auquel
est contenu l'art et science de la deue proportion des
lettres ... selon le corps et le visage humain</i>, and he
published it himself in small folio, putting upon it the
sign of Gilles de Gourmont, in 1529.</p>

<p>At heart Tory had been fascinated by the theories
of D&uuml;rer on the proportions of the human body; and
he says, "The noble German painter Albert D&uuml;rer is
greatly to be praised that he has so well brought to
light his art of painting in designing geometrical forms,
the ramparts of war, and the proportions of the human
body." He wished to indicate the true measure of
letters to his contemporaries, "the number of points
and turns of the compass that each one requires." The
most amusing part of this curious treatise is his short
academical preface, where, under a playful form, the
great publisher studies the orthography of his time,
and exclaims against the forgers of new words, the
Latinisers of the language, "the skimmers of Latin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
jesters and gibberers, ... who mock not only their
shadows, but themselves." The entire passage was
copied by Rabelais, nearly literally, and it indicates
that its author was possessed of good sense, which,
unhappily, all his contemporaries were not.</p>

<p>For the technical part, he added to his theories a
number of designs
of geometrical letters,
but he was
carried away, after
the fashion of the
time, by Greek
and Roman models,
perhaps a
little further than
he meant, losing
himself in the
midst of idle dissertations.
To
these geometrical
engravings he
added small and
charming figures,
said to be by Jean
Perr&eacute;al, as well
as emblematical letters of the nature of the Y which is
here given, with explanatory text and commentary.
To him this Y had two branches: one of virtue
and one of vice; that of virtue shows palms, crowns,
a sceptre, and a book; that of vice birches, a gallows,
and fire.</p>

<p>With the importance that cannot be denied to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
works, Geoffroy Tory founded a school; and it was
from his workshop that the plates came for the book
of Paulus Jovius on the dukes of Milan, published by
Robert Estienne in 1549, quarto. The portraits of the
dukes in this work have been attributed to Tory himself,
but he died in 1533, and there is not the least
indication that he engraved these sixteen portraits
with his own hand sixteen years before their publication.
Besides, our doubts as to the cross of Lorraine
being the exclusive signature of Tory, as has been believed,
lead us to think it the collective mark of a workshop,
as we meet it on works long after the death of the
master. As a proof, the mark is found on the engravings
of <i>L'Entr&eacute;e du Roi &agrave; Paris</i> in 1549, which cannot
be taken as a posthumous work of Tory, for these
engravings had their origin at a certain and special
date. But in spite of the absence of the monogram,
the admirable block from the Diodorus Siculus of
Antoine Macault might, from its design and engraving,
be considered as by Tory himself. Holbein, who,
about the same time, designed a somewhat similar
scene, the King of France seated on a throne receiving
poison from the hands of Death, never did anything
better. Within the scanty proportions of the design,
all the figures are portraits. Duprat, Montmorency and
the three sons of the King may be recognised; Macault,
on the left, is reading his translation to a circle of nobles
and men of letters. This admirable page is one of the
truest and most skilful of the monuments of French
engraving; it is equal to the best inventions of Holbein,
and it marks the culminating point of the illustration
of the Book before the exaggerations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
school of Fontainebleau. Geoffroy Tory was not the
publisher. The Diodorus Siculus, doubtless prepared
two or three years before, was not published
until 1535, in quarto, with his ordinary mark of the
"Pot Cass&eacute;."</p>

<p>We have now arrived through him at the reign of
Francis I., who was called the father of letters, and
who for various reasons favoured the arts. Doubtless
grand paintings and the decoration of the royal palaces
interested him more than vignettes in books and the
efforts of printers; but, at the same time, books occupied
him. He studied much, and in his travels accumulated
many volumes. An account in the French National
Archives shows that Claude Chappuis, his librarian,
packed entire cases, which were sent to Dauphin&eacute; at
the time of the wars of Piedmont, the carriage costing
twenty livres tournois. Francis had, moreover, following
sudden impulses, curious fits of wantonness and
mischief. It was perceived a little later that the doctrines
of Luther were propagated by the Book; and the
Sorbonne was up in arms, on the pretence of imposing
its own expurgated text of the Bible on the publishers
and tolerating no other. Theodore Beza, enemy of
the Sorbonnists, said with regard to this (we translate
the antique French literally), "Our great doctors
with cherubic visage have forbidden men to see the
Holy Bible in vulgar language, of which every one has
knowledge, because, they say, the desire of knowing
everything engenders nothing but error, fear, and care.
<i>Arguo sic</i>, if they so, for its abuse, wish to take away
this book, it is clear also that it is their duty to put away
the wine with which each of them makes himself drunk."</p>

<i>Chronologie Collée</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>This piece is only cited to show to what lengths
matters had gone, thanks to printing. It is very certain
that all the pamphlets, placards, and other horrors
published to raise religious warfare, did not aid in the
progress of the Book. The King was not always
disinterested on the technical question; books merited
encouragement, at least as much as castigation, and
besides, as time passed, they gradually transformed
men and ideas. In spite of apparent severities, was
not the King himself a little touched by contact
with the new religion, like his
sister Marguerite, or his sister-in-law,
Ren&eacute;e of Ferrara? However
that may be, he twice showed
himself a resolute partisan of
the celebrated Robert Estienne,
son-in-law and associate of Simon
de Colines, whose works in point
of erudition and typography assumed
day by day more importance.
Robert Estienne had the
great honour of being chosen from all his contemporaries
by King Francis as the royal printer. This prince
had ordered to be engraved for him by Claude Garamond,
after the design of Ange Verg&egrave;ce, the first
cutter of matrices of his time, a special Greek character
in three sizes, which was used in 1544 to
compose the "Ecclesiastical History" of Eusebius.
These are the famous royal types&mdash;<i>typi regii</i>&mdash;as
Estienne did not fail to indicate on the title-pages of
his works. It has been said since that Francis I.
founded the Royal Printing House, but the truth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
that Estienne kept these characters in his own office
for use in the royal editions; they may now be seen
in the Imprimerie Nationale at Paris.</p>

<p>Robert Estienne married the daughter of Josse Badius,
of Asch&mdash;Badius Ascencianus, one of the first Parisian
typographers of the time. We reproduce the mark of
Badius, representing
the interior of a printing
house, and shall
return in a special
chapter to the functions
of these workshops.
Meantime it
appears proper to
present to the reader
a printing office of
the time of Robert
Estienne and Geoffroy
Tory.</p>

<p>Robert Estienne
does not appear to
have concerned himself
much about the
decoration of the
Book. The purity
of the text and the characters were essentials with
him, erudition, and not art. He published many works
in Latin and Greek, among them the <i>Thesaurus</i>, a
great Latin dictionary published in 1532, also a Bible,
with notes by Vatable, revised by Leon de Juda. From
that came trouble. Leon de Juda was a partisan of
Zwingli; the Sorbonne accused the Bible of leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
towards the Huguenots; Francis I. took the part of
Estienne, but when that prince died Estienne fled to
Geneva, where he was accused of having imported the
royal types. The truth was that he simply imported
the matrices.</p>

<p>At this time everything served for the decoration of
the Book: portraits,
blazons, topographical
plates, costumes,
and emblems. Small
portraits engraved on
wood usually ornamented
the works of
the poets, like that
of Nicholas Bourbon,
for example, marvel
of truth and skill.
The blocks of frontispieces
in the folios
were multiplied; large
initial letters, ingeniously
engraved and
stippled, like that at
the commencement
of this chapter, were
used. Jacques Kerver reproduced in 1545 for himself,
and with plates made for him, the famous <i>Songe de
Poliphile</i>, published by Aldus in 1499. The widow of
the publisher Denis Janot, Jeanne de Marnef, published
one of the most delightful books of the time,
<i>L'Amour de Cupidon et de Psyche</i> of Apuleius, with
delicious figures in wood after Italian engravings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Many more could be named in the extraordinary profusion
of charming books.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;King and Death. Vignette from the "Dance of
Death" by Holbein.</p>
</div>

<p>Without entering into detail, something must be said
of Lyons, then a most extensive and prosperous centre
of bookselling. Lyons had the signal honour of publishing
first in France the celebrated cuts of the "Dance
of Death" of Holbein,
the Basle
painter. Doubtless
Treschel, the
printer, was not
the first, as a copy
of a German edition
is known, because
in the Lyons edition
the cuts are worn
and broken. However,
the Cabinet
d'Estampes of Paris
has some of the
figures of the Dance
with a German text,
probably printed by
Froben at Basle.
Treschel's title was
<i>Les Simulachres et Histori&eacute;es Faces de la Mort autant
elegamment pourtraictes que artificiellement imagin&eacute;es</i>,
and the volume in quarto was printed by Frelon. The
<i>Icones veteris testamenti</i>, which preceded the publication
of the "Dance of Death," had also been printed at
Basle before Lyons.</p>

<p>With Holbein, as with Geoffroy Tory, we arrive at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
zenith of illustration and marvellous skill of the engraver.
If we were to institute comparisons, it was Hans Lutzelburger
who cut the blocks after the designs of the Basle
master, but, contrary to what generally happens, the
translator reaches almost to the height of his model;
the line is perfection itself, it is precise and intelligent,
simple, and, above all, explicit. If the work of Lutzelburger
be admitted, it must also be admitted that
Holbein designed his cuts before 1526, date of the death
of the Basle engraver; but it was precisely before 1526
that Holbein lived in Basle, and it was after he had
travelled. We will add nothing to the universal praise
of the book of Treschel, of Lyons; everything has been
written of Holbein, and repetitions are unnecessary. We
would ask the reader to compare the Francis I. of Tory
and the King in Holbein's "Dance of Death;" there
is a certain family resemblance between the two cuts,
which is a singular honour for Tory.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the century Basle had a
school of <i>Formschneiders</i> working for export. Besides
the numerous products used at Lyons, it had also a
trade in wood blocks, which, having been used, were
afterwards sold. Among these exchanges of engravings
were many plates of Brandt's "Ship of Fools,"
sold in 1520 to Galliot du Pr&eacute;, publisher, of Paris, who
used them in the <i>Eloge de la Folie</i> of Erasmus.</p>

<p>The reign of Francis I. saw a great advance in the
national art of illustration. The arrival at the court of
Italian artists of the decadence, such as Rosso and Primaticcio,
produced a revolution in taste. The exaggerated
slightness of the figures brought by these artists from
beyond the Alps was considered as of supreme distinction;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
in their twisted draperies and mannered poses
was seen a precious beauty that tempted the ready
intelligence of the court of France. The simple and
ingenuous figures of the old French artists were ranked
among the refuse of another age, and their compositions
were regarded with contempt, and deemed antique.</p>

<p>The rage for emblems and for allegories and mythological
figures generally was well suited to these
eccentric and bizarre inventions. From another side,
an entire class of artists or artisans, book illustrators
first, then enamellers and jewellers, made use of these
Italian models, with which the King encumbered his
galleries, and which, at great expense, covered the walls
of Fontainebleau. One can understand what these
skilful men made of such a movement and of so thoughtless
an infatuation. The publishers saw the demand,
and composed works of which the sale was assured
by the subjects that they furnished to other designers.
This explains the quantity of Alciati's "Emblems" and
Ovid's "Metamorphoses" published at Lyons and Paris,
and copied and recopied a hundred times by the art industries
of the time. Without it the enormous success
of mediocre productions, as the "Emblems," for example,
in which the meaning of the enigma or rebus cannot
always be seized, is ill understood. It was Alciati who
made this literature the fashion. He was a sort of
Epicurean and miserly jurisconsult, who had as many
lords and masters on earth, as the kings and princes
who liked to bid against each other to engage him.
He had quitted Italy, seduced by the offers of
Francis I., but when Sforza paid him a larger sum, he
returned, giving as reason for his vacillation that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sun had to travel the earth and warm it by its rays;
this was an emblematic answer, for his emblems had
all the coarse, sceptical humour which not a few had
then already discovered. At most these philosophical
aphorisms, if we take them seriously, have their droll side
in that their author often practised the reverse of his
teaching. A miser, he abuses the avaricious; flying his
country for the love of gain, he blames those to whom
"a better condition is offered by strangers." Yet he is
sometimes logical and consistent, as when he assures
us that "poverty hinders the success of intelligence,"
and when, finally, lover of good cheer, he died of
indigestion in 1550.</p>

</div>


<p>His book of "Emblems" had a vogue that lasted until
the seventeenth century, and repetitions were infinitely
multiplied: at Paris by Wechel in 1534; at Lyons by
Hans de Tornes, of Suabia, one of the greatest Lyons
publishers; by Roville, also one of the first Lyons publishers,
and by Bonhomme; at Venice by the Alduses;
in fact, everywhere, translated into French, Spanish,
and Italian.</p>

<p>Bernard Salomon, called <i>le Petit Bernard</i>, born at
Lyons, was one of the designers of the school of
Fontainebleau&mdash;that is to say, of the Franco-Italian
school of which we have spoken above&mdash;who furnished
many of the engravings for books printed at Lyons.
He illustrated the edition of Alciati's "Emblems" published
by Bonhomme in 1560; and designed skilful
little plates, which, with the text, were surrounded by
a border from the workshop of Geoffroy Tory, for
Ovid's "Metamorphoses," published by Hans de Tornes
in 1564.  Bernard had all the defects and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
qualities of those of his time, from John Cousin to the
least of them; he was a Primaticcio on a small scale,
but agreeably so. His designs for the New Testament
were also very careful, but in them more than elsewhere
the manner and the affectation of the school of
Fontainebleau are apparent.</p>

</div>

<p>The workshops of the second city of France, we see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
had at this time attained considerable importance; but
before the books of which we shall speak, Roville
published two anonymous books, one <i>L'Entr&eacute;e du
Roi Henri II. &agrave; Lyon</i>, in 1549, ornamented with
very graceful woodcuts, the other the <i>Promptuaire des
M&eacute;dailles</i>, comprising a series of charming portraits
under the pretence of reproductions from the antique.
The designs of the <i>Entr&eacute;e</i> are often attributed to John
Cousin, as it is a rule with certain amateurs to give a
known name to a work; but it must be remembered
that Lyons then had celebrated artists, Petit-Bernard,
alluded to above, and Cornelis de la Haye, of whom
we have more to say; and it is not necessary to go to
Paris or to Rome to find the author of these illustrations.</p>

<p>Cornelis de la Haye was a painter who executed
nearly the same work as Francis Clouet in Paris,
portraits on panel, in a clear and harmonious tone,
then much the fashion. During a journey of the King,
he had, if Brant&ocirc;me may be credited, portrayed the
entire court, keeping the sketches for himself. Ten
or fifteen years after, Catherine de Medicis, passing
through Lyons, saw these portraits and highly praised
them, recognising the old costumes, astonished at the
courtiers of the day, whom she had never seen in such
dress. This artist is now known, thanks to various
works that have been found, among others two
portraits of the sons of Francis I., preserved by
Gaigni&egrave;res, who attributed them resolutely to Cornelis,
doubtless on the faith of inscriptions that have disappeared.
Both of them were engraved on wood at
Lyons and published in Roville's book the <i>Promptuaire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
des M&eacute;dailles</i>, mentioned above, with small differences
of detail altogether insignificant. It is not impossible
then that Cornelis designed these portraits, and that
they were drawn on wood after the cabinet models
spoken of by Brant&ocirc;me. The delicate figures of the
<i>Promptuaire</i> are the work of a master; and the differences
mentioned are those of the artist, not of the
copyist, who would not be permitted to change anything.
It is the first time, we believe, that these comparisons
have been made; they will perhaps help the
learned Lyonnais to pierce the mystery, but in any
case our suppositions are more honourable to Cornelis
de la Haye than the fancies of Robert Dumesnil
(<i>Peintre-graveur Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, tome vi., p. 343). To
judge by the four little medallions here reproduced,
the art of engraving on wood was rarely more skilful
than in these portraits. It would not be astonishing if
a man like Cornelis had designed the figures of the
<i>Entr&eacute;e de Henri II.</i> In any case, why should we choose
John Cousin instead of Petit-Bernard? At this time,
we know, the kings carried in their suite their ordinary
painters; but we do not know that John Cousin
followed the court to Lyons in 1549. He did not hold
an official position, like Clouet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>This artist produced well-authenticated works; one
of them is signed, and leaves no doubt: the <i>Livre de
Perspective de Jehan Cousin Senonois, Maistre Painctre</i>,
published in 1560 by Jean le Royer, printer to the
King for mathematics. This profession of printer for
mathematics had its difficulties of engraving, for Le
Royer tells us in his preface that he had himself
finished the plates commenced by Albin Olivier. In
another practical treatise, entitled <i>Livre de Portraiture</i>,
published in 1593, John Cousin is styled <i>peintre
g&eacute;ometrien</i>. It is beyond doubt that this master
produced for many works figures and ornaments,
but what were the books? The manner was then to
repeat the engraved borders of titles, the <i>passe-partout</i>,
in the centre of which the text was printed. Cousin
designed many of these title-pages on wood; that
of the <i>Livre de Portraiture</i> affords a curious element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
of comparison; but he was not by any means the inventor.
In 1555 was sold at Antwerp a book printed
from engraved plates after John Vriedman, by Gerard
Juif, which is simply a collection of engravings for
title-pages for the use of publishers.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>It is about this time that metal plates may be seen in
conjunction with wood engraving in the illustration of
the Book, and the best artists attached their names to
important publications of this kind. We have explained
in a former chapter in what this process is least convenient
in the impression of a book. In fact, two successive
printings, that of the plates and that of the text,
were additional trouble and a frequent cause of errors;
but wood-cutting was somewhat abandoned in the
middle of the sixteenth century, especially for separate
plates, and engraved plates took a considerable importance
under different artistic influences. The first was
the facility of engraving a metal plate compared to the
difficulty of cutting a wood block. It thus naturally
happened that the artists of the burin wished to employ
their art in illustration, and taste was soon drawn to
the new process.</p>

<p>In France the first volume of this kind was printed in
1488 by Topie de Pymont in folio: the <i>P&eacute;r&eacute;grinations
en Terre Sainte</i> of Bernard de Breydenbach, with figures
on engraved plates copied from the Mayence edition of
1486. Since this manner was abandoned until about
1550, as much for the reasons given above as for others,
we only meet with a stray plate now and again, which
remains as a bait, and relates to nothing. Under
the reign of Henri II. the smallness of the volumes
did not always admit of wood engravings, and the
artists in metal found a footing among illustrators;
they made attempts, such as that of the <i>Histoire de
Jason</i> of R&eacute;n&eacute; Boivin in 1563, which came out under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Charles IX. in a charming volume of engraved plates
by P. Wo&eacute;riot.</p>

<p>The "Emblems" of Georgette de Montenay were
also in the burlesque style of Alciati, but they had
an advantage, as the author assures us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="iquot">"Alciat fist des embl&egrave;mes exquis,</div>
<div>Lesquels, voyant de plusieurs requis,</div>
<div>D&eacute;sir me prist de commencer les miens,</div>
<div>Lesquels je croy estre premiers chrestiens."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This orthodoxy does not make them more intelligible,
but the engravings of Wo&eacute;riot, unskilful as they are,
import an element of interest which surpasses the rest.
It was always at Lyons, the rival and often the master
of Paris in typography, that the author printed his
work.</p>

<p>By the privilege dated 1566, five years before publication,
we see that it is permitted to Peter Wo&eacute;riot,
engraver of the Duke of Lorraine, to portray, engrave,
and cut in copper the said figures called emblems for
the time and term of five years (18th October, 1566).
Peter Wo&eacute;riot sometimes signed his prints with the
small Lorraine cross adopted by Geoffroy Tory's workshop,
as may be seen in our engraving.</p>

<p>Copper plate engraving had by this time established
itself, and the works that were so illustrated spread
themselves. Du Cerceau published his admirable
collection of <i>Plus Beaux Bastiments de France</i> in
folio 1576-79, which had numerous plans and views of
the royal and princely castles. Thevet put forth his
<i>Cosmographie Universelle</i> and his <i>Hommes Illustres</i>, the
latter adorned with skilfully engraved portraits. In
Paris the publishers Mamert Patisson, who married the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
widow of Robert Estienne and took his mark, Adrien
le Roy, and Robert Ballard, published the celebrated
<i>Ballet Comique de la Royne Faict aux Nopces de Monsieur
le Duc de Joyeuse</i>, composed by Balthasar de Beaujoyeux,
valet de chambre to Henri III.; and in this book, in
which were put hasty etchings, the King displayed all
his immodesty and depravity. The Book has often had
the unconscious mission of transmitting to posterity
the unworthiness of its author or of its heroes. From
this time the Book has left its golden age to enter into
the boastings of courtiers and political abstractions.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>Among the publications opposed to the Government
of the time, the two associates James Tortorel and
John Perrissin, of Lyons, had published a celebrated
collection of plates on the religious wars that stained
the reign of Charles IX. with blood. At first engraved
on metal, these plates were worn out, and were gradually
replaced by others engraved on wood, on which several
artists worked, among them James le Challeux and
also John de Gourmont, one of the most celebrated
wood-cutters of the sixteenth century. This was a
work composed of single leaves in folio size, which
had an extraordinary sale among the religious people
of the time.</p>

<p>At the same time, illustration on wood did not stand
still. The portraits of authors diffused by the pencil of
Clouet and his school were commonly put at the head
of their works. We cannot say whether Clouet himself
designed the portraits of Tiraqueau and of Taillemont in
1553; of Du Billon, the author of the <i>Fort Inexpugnable</i>,
in 1555; Papon and Ambroise Par&eacute; in 1561; Grevin,
Ramus, and others; but the precision of these physiognomies
recalls the peculiar manner of the French artists
of the sixteenth century. The "Poems" of Ronsard
in 1586 contains a series of very clever portraits,
among them that of Muret, his commentator, one of the
most perfect of its kind. Christopher de Savigny, author
of the <i>Tableaux Accomplis de Tous les Arts Liberaux</i>,
published by John and Francis de Gourmont in 1587,
is represented at full length in the frontispiece of his
work, offering the book to the Duc de Nevers, to
whom it is dedicated. This plate in folio, probably engraved
by John de Gourmont, is the best finished that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
we have seen. The work of Savigny, forgotten as it
may be now, had a great reputation in its own time;
and Bacon took from it the idea of his "Advancement
of Learning."</p>

<p>Speaking of the Duc de Nevers, it will not be without
interest to our readers to mention here a manuscript
found by us in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, which
enables us to give an account of the work then necessary
for the publication of an illustrated book. In 1577 the
Duke arranged for the impression of an apologetic book,
of which no trace remains; and his <i>intendant</i> writes a
long letter to him on the subject of composition and
bindings. It was necessary that the work should be
produced quickly, bound and gilt, for presents. The
<i>intendant</i> thinks calf will be the most expeditious
covering. "It would be much the best to use black or
red calf, ... well gilt above, and not vellum, which is
a thin parchment that quickly shrinks." The statements
of this man of business show that five proofs of
each sheet were taken for typographical correction, and
that twelve full days were wanted for the binding. The
most interesting part of this memoir is that which
treats of the engraving on wood of the portrait. The
plate was designed by an artist who had afterwards
gone away; it was not satisfactory, but the ornaments
would pass. The <i>intendant</i> proposes to "fix a little
piece of wood in the block that could be drawn upon."
Here we see correction by elimination. The pear-wood
on which the original figure was engraved was to be
cut out, and a square of boxwood substituted, "forasmuch
as in this task the pear-wood, which is the
successful, well-cut block, is the wood that is harder."</p>

<p>The portrait of the Duchesse de Nevers was better, yet
the pear-wood had given way under the work. "That
of Madame is more passable. Nevertheless, there is still
something to say to one eye. The wood cannot carry the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
subtlety of the line." Here, in a few clear and explicit
lines by a man of the time, we see the economy of a
publication of the sixteenth century, at a time when
wood engraving was declining, to give place to engraving
on metal, which was soon to reign supreme, through
the most important book house of the century: the
Plantins of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Christopher Plantin, like Jenson, came originally
from Tours. After having learned his art with Mac&eacute; at
Caen, he went to Paris, from which the wars soon
drove him. He left for the Low Countries, and there
Philip II. nominated him as chief printer&mdash;"architypographus."
Established at Antwerp in 1555, he surrounded
himself, as had the Estiennes and Alduses,
with most of the learned and literary men of his time,
among them Justus Lipsius, to whom Balzac attributed
the Latin prefaces signed by Plantin. It is certain that
he was neither an Estienne nor an Aldus. His artistic
probity caused him to submit the proofs of his works to
strangers, with promise of recompense for faults indicated;
the Estiennes employed the same system.
Plantin, not to be behind any of his contemporaries in
typographical perfection, brought from France the
celebrated type-founder William Leb&eacute;, and charged
him to furnish a special fount.<a name="FNanchor_A_5" id="FNanchor_A_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Under the orders of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>Philip II., he printed the celebrated Polyglot Bible, in
eight folio volumes, absolutely perfect in its execution;
unfortunately the Spanish Government, having advanced
funds in the course of publication, prosecuted
him with the utmost rigour to obtain repayment. This
very nearly shut up his printing house, but he took
courage and overcame
his difficulties,
until he became, in
1589, the year of
his death, the principal
publisher of
Flanders. His
mark was a hand
holding a compass,
with the motto "Labore
et constantia."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_5" id="Footnote_A_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale is a copy of an octavo <i>Album de
Caract&egrave;res</i>, in which Leb&eacute; has written, "This gloss, made in Paris
(1574) by me, is my fourteenth letter, and the text is made on the pattern
of the preceding one for size, but of a better art; and from this was
printed the great Bible of Antwerp by Plantin, to whom I sold a
fount" (folio 6). On folio 20 he wrote, "I do not know whence came
this small Hebrew that I received from Plantin to make a smaller one
for him. He sent me this half-sheet, and I have not seen at Venice
another part."</p></div>

</div>

<p>Plantin died at
the age of seventy-four,
leaving a
prosperous business
to be divided
between his three
daughters. His
first house at Antwerp
employed
seventeen presses even at the time when he was in
trouble, and he had branches at Paris and Leyden, of less
consequence. His second daughter married Moretus,
and to him descended the Antwerp workshop; he and
his descendants continued the printing house until
recently; the house of the great printer and publisher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
is now a typographical museum. The Plantin printing
office&mdash;"Officina Plantiniana"&mdash;was as well managed by
its descendants as by himself. The fashion of engraving
in metal spread itself before the death of the head of
the house, and his successors continued it. The principal
engravers with the burin of the Low Countries
were employed by them: Wierix, Galle, Pass, Mallery,
Van Sichern; it was a real school of illustration, that
created by degrees a precious and sustained style, not
without influence on the artists of that epoch. It
was from this particular manner that came Thomas de
Leu and Leonard Gaultier in France; and from Antwerp
came those small religious figures that have lasted to
our time in their incomprehensible mysticism.</p>

<p>The title-pages of the Plantin printing office inaugurated
the <i>passe-partout</i> engraved by the burin,
overloaded and complicated, of which the seventeenth
century took advantage. To tell the truth, these elaborate
displays, blackened by ink, do not accord well with
the titles; and there is a long distance between this
decadence and the books ornamented with wood blocks
by the Italians and French of the commencement of the
century. Exception must be made in favour of Rubens,
who designed many of these titles. The heavy and
squat architecture of the time was least of all appropriate
to these decorations, which wanted grace. It passed
from Plantin into France through the engravers; it went
to Rome with Martin de Vos and John Sadeler; it imposed
itself everywhere; and from that day to this it
has not ceased. At the time of which we write it had
taken its flight in France, and spread itself in Europe
with extraordinary success. Engraving in relief, holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
its own until then, gave way little by little before
this invasion. When Henri IV. mounted the throne
wood engraving had finished its upward movement, it
still remained in the <i>canards</i>, or popular pieces sold
at low prices, but it is easy to see what these hasty
vignettes are worth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>We have now seen the history of the Book and its
decoration in the sixteenth century in France: at first
French epics in Italy, books of hours, romances of
chivalry; then about 1550, with the reign of Henri II.,
the religious pamphlets commenced, bookselling spread
itself; the strife between illustrations on metal plates
and those in relief assumed shape, it continued under
Henri III., and terminated abruptly by the victory of
the first at the extreme end of the century. With
political passions, printing had become a weapon of
warfare, which it will never cease to be. They knew
in the sixteenth century what perfidious accusations
or excessive praises were worth. The Book followed
the fate of its author. If the writer was burned, so was
his book. Witness the <i>Christianismi Restitutio</i> of the
Catholic Servetus, printed at Vienne, in Dauphin&eacute;, and
consigned to the flames with its author at Geneva in 1553.
A single copy was saved from the fire, and is now preserved
in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale; it is the identical
copy annotated by Colladon, the accuser of the unhappy
Servetus, and still bears traces of fire on its leaves.</p>

<p>Typography and the illustration of the Book in
England in the sixteenth century did not make the
same progress as in France and Italy. Much good
work was done, but it was mostly with foreign material.
Type was obtained from French and Dutch founders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and most of the woodcuts had the same origin. In
the early part of the century most of the publications
were translations of popular foreign books, such as
Voragine's "Golden Legend," Caxton's translations of
Cicero, Boetius, etc. Too many restrictions and privileges
obtained to encourage or allow of the establishment
of an English school, which was to come later
with the spread of wealth and education. Books were
mostly printed in Gothic type, or "black letter," and
the woodcuts were of the coarsest kind. An exception
was the beautiful Prayer-book of John Day, 1578,
known as Queen Elizabeth's Prayer-book, from the
fine portrait of the Queen, which we reproduce, on
the previous page; but in this the woodcuts were
designed by Albert D&uuml;rer and Hans Holbein. Pynson
was the first to use Roman type in England, in the
<i>Oratio in pace nuperrim&acirc;</i>, 1518, quarto; and the first
English Bible in Roman type was printed at Edinburgh
in 1576. It is thought that until about 1600 printers
were their own type-founders, as no record exists of
founding as a separate trade until that time.</p>

</div>

<p>The greatest achievement of the sixteenth century
in England was the printing of the first English Bible,
in Coverdale's translation, in 1535, folio, but even this
was printed abroad, the latest investigation giving it to
Van Meteren at Antwerp. The woodcuts in it are by
Hans Sebald Beham; we reproduce one representing
Cain killing Abel. Tyndall had previously printed
abroad an English New Testament. Another importation
was Brandt's "Shyp of Folys," printed by Pynson,
1509, and John Cawood, 1570, the woodcuts in both
being copied from the originals before referred to.</p>

<p>Folio was the size usually adopted, and in this size
the series of chronicles appeared: Arnold, printed
abroad in 1502; Fabian, in 1516; Froissart, by
Pynson, in two volumes, 1523-5; Harding, by Grafton,
1543; Hall, by the same, 1548; Holinshed, in two
volumes, 1577. In the same size Chaucer was first
given to the world entire by T. Godfrey in 1532, and
many times reprinted, and Sir Thomas More in 1557.
Polemical and religious treatises were mostly printed
in quarto, as were the poets: Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>,
in 1590; Langland's <i>Pierce Plowman</i>, in 1550; and
Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, in 1590. Plays were also printed in
quarto, in which shape at the end of the century some
of Shakespeare's single plays were issued.</p>

<p>From the great perfection to which the liturgies, or
books of hours, had been brought by Vostre, Verard,
and others in France, it is not perhaps extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
that the service books for English use should have
been mostly printed abroad. Those for Salisbury and
York were produced at Paris, Rouen, and Antwerp.
A Salisbury Primer in English was printed by John
Kyngston and Henry Sutton in 1557, and Wynken
de Worde printed a York Manual in 1509. The first
English Common Prayer Book, known as Edward VI.'s,
was printed by Grafton in 1549, who also printed in
1545 Henry VIII.'s Primer in Latin and English.
Edward's book is curious as having on the last page
a royal order as to the price at which it was to be
sold: "No maner of persone shall sell the present
Booke vnbounde aboue the price of two shillynges and
two pence. And bound in Forell for ii<i>s.</i> x<i>d.</i>, and not
aboue. And the same bound in Shepes Lether for iii<i>s.</i>
iii<i>d.</i>, and not aboue. And the same bounde in paste
or in boordes, in Calues Lether, not aboue the price
of iiii<i>s.</i> the pece." Cranmer's Catechism was printed
by Nicholas Hill in 1548, with twenty-nine woodcuts
by Hans Holbein, one of which we reproduce, representing
Christ casting out devils.</p>

<p>Translations from the classics were popular, and in
the second half of the century arose that passion for
voyage and travel which has so largely contributed to
the wealth and extension of England. This was begun
by Eden's translation of Peter Martyr's "Decades of the
New World; or, West India," London, 1555, quarto,
followed by Hakluyt's "Principall Navigations, Voyages,
and Discoveries," 1589, folio. Many accounts of single
voyages and discoveries were issued, and the taste
thus created culminated in the establishment of the
East India Company in the last year of the century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>The first specimen of copper plate engraving for
books in England is a frontispiece to Galen's <i>De
Temperamentis</i>, printed at Cambridge 1521, and the
number of books containing copper plates engraved
before 1600 is extremely limited, the most notable
being portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Lord Leicester, and
Lord Burleigh in Archbishop Parker's Bible of 1568;
Saxton's Atlas, 1579, the first atlas in England;
Harrington's translation of Ariosto, 1591, with forty-seven
engraved plates.</p>

<p>The first printer at Cambridge was John Siberch,
1521. Peter of Treves established himself at Southwark
in 1514. Among his productions is a Higden's
<i>Polychronicon</i>, 1527, folio. John Oswen printed at
Ipswich 1538, and among the English towns in which
printers established themselves in the century were
York, Canterbury, Tavistock, Norwich, and Worcester.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Reformed Church, and the
diffusion of education among the people which followed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
created an original English school of literature in the
sixteenth century, and this gave employment and great
impetus to typography in England, so that by the time
we reach the end of the century we find a great improvement
in the art of the Book, to be carried to
still greater perfection in the next.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1">NOW we have arrived at a
critical epoch, in which the
science of the old printers
transformed itself gradually
into commerce, in
which taste lost itself
under the influence of religious
architecture.
The title of the Book represents
the portico of a
cathedral, with columns,
mitred saints, and crosses,
of little decorative aspect.  Figures on copper plates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
replaced the foliage and arabesques of the older
booksellers. Through the Plantins and their imitators,
the architectural passion was far spread. It
inundated France, ran through Germany and Italy, and
reigned pre-eminent in Holland. Literary taste also
underwent change; manners were no longer those of
the sixteenth century: bold, free, and gay; from the
religious wars a certain hypocrisy arose; bombast replaced
the natural; the gods were preparing, as a
contemporary said, to receive Louis and his spirit.</p>

<p>It is not that artists were wanting at the opening of
the seventeenth century who could, in giving scope to
their talent, show themselves worthy successors of
those who went before them. Unhappily the booksellers
no longer had a loose rein; they had the
rope, for they were hung or burned at the least infraction
of political or religious propriety. Yet the reign
of Henri IV. was relatively an easier period for the
artisans of the Book, in which they were less confined
to the strict terms of excessive regulations; but after
this prince severity increased, and during the year
1626 a new law was promulgated punishing with
death the printers or distributers of prohibited books.
Doubtless the books that were thus secretly sold, and
prohibited in defence of good manners, were neither
<i>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of typography nor art. The author threw
off the indecencies by which he hoped to make profit
and fame, regardless of type or illustration. But during
the regency of Marie de Medicis, it was not only the
authors of a bad standard that were in danger of being
hung; the printer or seller of the pamphlet or book of
a reputed heterodox author was also hung, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
became difficult to steer safely among the prohibitions.
Enormous numbers of works were made with frontispieces
decorated with colonnades and mitred saints,
and bearing high-sounding titles of sound orthodoxy.
A somewhat gross mysticism, from the office of Plantin,
formed the most solid stock of every respectable dealer.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Under Henri IV. and the minority of Louis XIII.,
two French illustrators received from the school of
Antwerp their inspiration for the ornament of the Book.
Thomas de Leu, probably from Flanders, was allied
with the old Parisian painter and engraver of celebrated
portraits, Antoine Caron, in furnishing the engraved
plates for the <i>Images de Plate Peinture des Deux Philostrates,
Sophistes Grecs</i>, Paris, Claude Cramoisy, 1609,
folio; and Leonard Gaultier, his contemporary, collaborated
with Jaspar Isaac and other artists in the Book.
Leonard Gaultier contributed most to spread in France
the Plantinian style, and his somewhat cold but characteristic
talent suited this art more than that of any one
else then could. He was an engraver of portraits, now
rare and valuable, in the style of Wierix or Thomas de
Leu; but, at the demand of publishers and booksellers,
he composed other plates, at first historical figures representing
the royal family and the nobles for the
publisher Leclerc, in a simple and true manner; he also
designed pious figures, recording a miracle or representing
the ceremonies of a jubilee and other devotional
things. But he made his great success in the composition
of frontispieces to theological and pious works, printed
for nearly all the booksellers. Leonard Gaultier had a
fashion of his own with pilasters and Grecian columns,
under which he boldly placed entire councils of cardinals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and bishops; witness the heading of the <i>Bibliotheca
Veterum Patrum</i>, into which he crowded nearly forty
figures. He united also with a certain grace the
sacred and the profane, placing among ideal saints
the sinning fine ladies of the time, with their large
collarettes and jewels falling on naked breasts. The
work of Andrew Valladier, chaplain of the King, entitled
<i>M&eacute;tan&eacute;alogie Sacr&eacute;e</i>, published by Peter Chevallier in
1609, was adorned with a title of this particular kind, in
which Gaultier had no rival, and which preserves the
precision of Flemish masters in the detail of ornaments
of the toilet.</p>

<p>He was one of the first to work for Sebastian
Cramoisy, printer and publisher, who had established
his shop in the Rue St. Jacques at the sign of the
"Stork." We shall have occasion to speak of him later
in connection with the Royal Printing House, of which
he was the first director; he is mentioned now because
in 1611 Leonard Gaultier engraved for him the frontispiece
of <i>L'Aigle Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, a collection of sermons
by Thomas Girault. The publisher used the same plate
in 1618 for the sermons of Raymond de H&eacute;z&egrave;que.</p>

<p>Besides the publications of Sebastian Cramoisy and
Chevallier, Leonard Gaultier adorned also those of
Nicholas Buon and many other publishers of the time
in Paris and Lyons. With such a profusion of works
emanating from a single artist, without reckoning those
which were produced in great quantity by men of less
note, wood engraving was dead. At most it dared
to put a wood block of a printer's mark on a title;
more ordinarily this mark was not alone sufficient,
and showed the disdain in which taste then held wood-cutting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Thus goes fashion, heedless of the most
elementary rules of art. To put type within an engraved
title, or to ornament a printed text with engravings,
is a heresy of principle that was established in the
eighteenth century, by the strength of its cleverness
and talent. But at the beginning of the seventeenth,
in spite of Leonard Gaultier or Thomas de Leu, these
overloaded titles, overpowering the opening of the
Book, offend the eye by their excessive blackness, and
incontestably make us regret the admirable frontispiece
on wood of the preceding century.</p>

<p>This is all the ornament, properly so called, of the
reign of Louis XIII. Leonard Gaultier composed also
small vignettes for an edition of Homer, but they are
mediocre and unskilful, and it must be said that there
were others following the same path. John Picart made
a frontispiece with architecture and figures for the
<i>Histoire de la Maison de Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Marne</i> for account
of Sebastian Cramoisy. A cold and hard artist he was,
the rival of Gaultier, and one of the most employed of
the vignette engravers of Paris. There was also Jaspar
Isaac, a mediocre craftsman, but who could design
clever titles, among them that of the continuation of
the <i>Annales</i> of Baronius for the publisher Denis de la
Noue. Then Claude Mellan, whose great and clever
talent did not disdain second-rate works, in which he
gave free play to his burin. It must be said, however,
that his bold touch did not well accommodate itself
to reduced spaces, and that he was not working in the
field necessary to his inventive powers. We mention
his portrait of Louis XIV. at the head of the <i>Code Louis
XIV.</i>; the title of the <i>Perfection du Chrestien</i>, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
is included a portrait of Cardinal Richelieu, A. Vitr&eacute;,
1647, folio; that of the <i>Instruction du Dauphin</i> for
Cramoisy, 1640; that of the works of St. Bernard for
the Royal Printing House; and, perhaps the best of
all, the <i>Po&eacute;sies</i> of Pope Urban VIII., of which we here
give a copy.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Lyons did not remain far behind in the movement,
but how changed from its great reputation of the
sixteenth century! J. de Fornazeris engraved the
frontispieces to Justus Lipsius, published by Horace
Cardon in 1613. Peter Favre and Audran imitated
them. C. Audran designed for Claude Landry the
<i>Theologia Naturalis</i> of Theophilus Reynaud, and the
bookseller Picquet ordered from him the title for the
<i>Annales Minorum</i> in 1628. Everywhere taste was
modelled on the works of the capital, to name only
the principal centres, Rouen, Rheims, Sens, down to
Venes, a small town of Tarn, where William de Nautonnier
published in 1603 his curious book <i>M&eacute;com&eacute;trie</i>,
whose frontispiece was bordered by views of cities,
with an equestrian portrait of King Henry.</p>

<p>And if we pass to Germany, we find Mayence with
mediocre engravings for titles according to the formula
and process used elsewhere, the title of the <i>Droit Civil</i>
of Aymar Vailius, that of the works of St. Bonaventura
in 1609 for the bookseller Antoine Hi&eacute;rat, and that of
the <i>Viridarium Virtut&ucirc;m</i>, rather cleverly treated by the
burin in 1610. What a period had passed since Gutenberg,
Fust, and Schoeffer! There was still one Yves
Schoeffer at Mayence, but only the name lived; nothing
more remained of the old printers of the other
century. It was the same at Bamberg, Cologne, Nuremberg,
and Basle, in all the cities that made the honour of
typography and the Book in former times. Cologne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
was neither better nor worse favoured than others. The
booksellers Boetzer, Kinck, and De Binghy had passable
engravings for their titles; and the Commentaries
of Salmeron may be mentioned, with portraits from the
German originals of the fifteenth century. At Nuremberg
there was a curious specimen treating of natural
history by Basil Besler, in which the artist gives the
interior of a zoological cabinet of the time; but the
blocks and the typography of the city of Koburger are
wanting. Basle held its own later in relief engraving.
Meantime there was a mediocre set of the Dance of
Death on copper, published by Miegen, 1621.</p>

<p>At Jena and Frankfort-on-the-Main were prosperous
printing houses, but engravings and ornamentation
were neglected. Frankfort employed the frontispiece
in the <i>Trait&eacute; du Commerce</i> of Sigismond Scaccia,
published by Zuner in 1648; it was divided into compartments,
in which the Bourse, the Exchange, and the
port of the city were represented.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to mention the Italian cities
which followed the movement. Venice from the
middle of the sixteenth century had used engraved
frontispieces, among which was that of Domenic Zenoi
for the <i>Portraits des Hommes Illustres</i> of Nicholas
Valegio. In the same city James Piccini worked for
account of Sgava in 1648, but he was equally at the
service of Roman publishers, for whom he designed a
number of titles. Along with him Frederic Greuter
adorned the publications of Alexander Zanetti, not without
talent, but without individuality. Bologna, Brescia,
Florence, and Naples, had no original sentiment; they
followed indifferently the manner of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>In Holland, artists were rather numerous. The
family of the Passes designed vignettes for books, and
engraved frontispieces, admirably studied and composed.
The clear and truly personal style of their works
places their illustrations in the first rank among those
of their time. They had, at the same time, the genius
that created and the intelligent burin that faithfully
translated an idea. They imagined with art the scenes
that they depicted without at all copying their predecessors.
From 1599, the date of the publication
of the <i>Hortus Deliciarum</i>, one of their best works, up
to about 1623, they were in Holland, at Arnheim and
at Amsterdam. In 1623 we find one of them, the
most celebrated, Crispin the younger, designing figures
for the <i>Man&egrave;ge Royal</i> of Pluvinel, published by Angelier
in Paris, and for another edition, with folding plates,
in 1624 for William Lenoir, at the sign of the
"White Rose Crowned." This magnificent work, in
which the King, Louis XIII., is represented receiving
lessons from the rider Pluvinel, had a third and
more complete reimpression in 1625 with another
publisher, Michael Nivelle. Here we see the Dutch
accredited in France, in Paris, in the city then the
most ready to understand and pay for the works of
eminent artists. In 1624 Gombauld published an
<i>Endymion</i>&mdash;Boileau later associated Gombauld with
other poets to declare him a maker of pitiable sonnets&mdash;Nicholas
Buon, the bookseller named above, undertook
the publication, and employed Pass, Leonard Gaultier,
and J. Picart to furnish plates in octavo size. Heavy
and black as were these vignettes, they do not the less
make a good appearance in the edition of the forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
poet; and it is due to truth to recognise how much Pass
was above his collaborators. The following year, 1625,
he engraved the <i>Dionysiaques</i> of Nonus, for Robert
Fouet, and the <i>Roman des Romans</i> of Du Verdier, comprising
more than ten engravings, in a very free and
bold manner. The <i>Berger Extravagant</i> and the <i>Acad&eacute;mie
de l'Esp&eacute;e</i> came in 1628, among numerous others.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>To speak truly, Crispin Pass did not devote himself
entirely to Parisian publishers; he always preserved
interests in Flanders so as to return there from time to
time; but he did not find in his own country the ready
and assured sales of Paris. Still the city of Leyden had
then one of the most renowned workshops of typography;
the Elzevirs had commenced to make a good
place for themselves among the printers of Europe by
the extreme correctness of their editions, the distinctness
of their work, and their marvellous art in the taste
and economy of the Book. In reality, the sizes and
characters of their books were very small, but if the
smallness of the page did not allow room for vignette
or ornament, they bore a certain practical elegance
that was not without charm. The origin of the printing
house was due to Louis Elzevir, who published in 1592
an edition of Eutropius at Leyden. He left sons, who
associated themselves together, and founded a house
which was unrivalled.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;Title of the <i>Imitation</i> of the Elzevirs.</p>
</div>

<p>Bonaventure Elzevir, grandson of Louis, was the
most illustrious of this family, so remarkably devoted to
its art. He took Abraham as partner, and together
they put forth those little Latin classics in duodecimo of
which the value is now so great. Among others, Pliny
issued from their presses in the year 1635, in three
volumes, Virgil in 1636, and Cicero in 1642. To-day
amateurs, above all those afflicted with bibliomania,
hunt for unbound Elzevirs, because they have full
margins. From about 1633 to 1639 these volumes were
composed of paper of rather small size, making a
page of a hundred and thirty to a hundred and thirty-three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
millimetres; from 1639 onwards the paper was
larger, and the page from about a hundred and thirty-five
to a hundred and thirty-seven. One must be a
book-lover to understand the interest attaching to these
figures, and employ his entire activity in the discovery
of these undiscoverable books, which are concealed as
soon as they are met with.</p>

<p>One of the most esteemed of their works is the
<i>De Imitatione</i> of Thomas &agrave; Kempis, printed by John and
Daniel Elzevir about 1653, and known as the edition
without date. But as the association of John and
Daniel is known to have lasted from 1652 to 1654, the
date 1653 appears to be very plausible. We reproduce
the entire title of this typographical <i>bijou</i>, which
merited a cleverer engraver.</p>

<p>The rarest of all the numerous Elzevirs, possibly by
reason of the popularity of its subject, is the <i>Pastissier
Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, Louis and Daniel Elzevir, Amsterdam, 1655,
of which M. Morgand had an uncut copy, measuring
a hundred and forty-three millimetres, in 1878.
The Benzon copy sold in 1875 for three thousand two
hundred and fifty-five francs.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that the Elzevirs frequently
avoided dating or even signing their books, for reasons
easy to comprehend. Publishing numerous works, they
were afraid of compromising themselves in the eyes
of the powerful, and they let them go forth without
any trade mark. These artists in typography were,
besides, the most prudent and subtle of men. Working
at a time when bookselling had become an acknowledged
commerce, and a trade requiring all the skill and
resources of others, they wisely availed themselves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
these, gathering for themselves honour and profit without
having done more than seize their opportunity.
Employing the characters of Claude Garamond, of
James Sanlecques, and the papers of Angoul&ecirc;me,
M. Didot thence claims them as French publishers.</p>

<p>In France the Elzevirs had no rivals; but a fashion
was introduced from the end of the sixteenth century
of associating together publishers in the production of
important and costly books. There were, among others,
the company of the "Grand Navire" in 1610, of the
"Source" in 1622, and of the "Soleil" in 1629. In 1631
several publishers united and founded a second company
of the "Grand Navire." These were the two Cramoisys,
Sebastian and Gabriel, Denis B&eacute;chet, John Branchu,
Denis Moreau, Claude Sonnius, and Denis Thierry. The
associates took a ship as their mark, but without putting
their names on the masts, as the original company of the
"Grand Navire" had done. They published, at common
expense and divided profits, great works, of which each
one of them had the right of sale, but of course reserving
to themselves the right to publish such others as
they pleased. Sebastian Cramoisy passes as the
chief, the moral director of another company, formed
to publish the Fathers of the Church, with the royal
types, a company affiliated to the "Grand Navire"
and signed in 1638 by Denis Moreau, Gille Morel,
Stephen Richer, Claude Sonnius, and Gabriel Cramoisy.
But as regards their personal works, if they had
neither the perfection nor the aspect of those of
Froben, Aldus, the Estiennes, or even of Plantin,
they at least surpassed the French books of the time.
Formerly syndic of the Corporation in 1602, twenty-nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
years before the constitution of the "Grand Navire,"
Cramoisy was besides sheriff of Paris, and he exercised
his trade in a shop in the Rue St. Jacques which had
been that of Father Nivelle, the <i>doyen</i> of booksellers,
who died in 1603 at the age of eighty years.</p>

<p>The position of Cramoisy made it natural for
Cardinal de Richelieu to fix his eyes on him for the
direction of the Royal Printing House. This establishment,
founded by the King in 1640, was installed within
the Louvre, in a long series of rooms which formed a
workshop without rival in the world. Sublet des
Noyers was named superintendent, Trichet du Fresne
corrector; and under this triple direction the presses
commenced to work. The first book was the <i>Imitation
de J&eacute;sus-Christ</i>, dated 1640, folio, a fine book enough,
but not to be compared to the Elzevir editions. The
types used in this book are attributed to Claude Garamond,
founder of the sixteenth century, to whom are
due the Greek types of Francis I. With the Royal
Printing House, as often happens with State enterprises,
the cost was great, and the return nothing. Only a few
years after its foundation it had swallowed up nearly
400,000 livres, a very heavy sum for a badly balanced
treasury; it had produced sixty or seventy volumes of
moderate value; and after Cramoisy the management
was so little in earnest that it turned the workshops
into a stable, called "the little stable of the King," at
the commencement of the eighteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>To return to the artists of the Book under Louis
XIII. and Cardinal Richelieu, we must go back a little,
before the foundation of the Royal Printing House, and
we shall find the French school of illustration at a time
when Callot was giving it a vigorous lift and trying
to do away with its affected and hard style. It must be
acknowledged that Callot was not a vignettist, a special
designer; his art aimed higher, and ordinarily succeeded
better; yet he did not disdain frontispieces, and made
them for the <i>Coustumier de Lorraine</i>, the <i>Harpalice</i> of
Bracciolini, and for a crowd of others of which the
enumeration would be tedious. Certain of his works
passed into Italy, where they raised a little the debased
level of the Book. Then he adorned several works
with etchings, among them the <i>Lumi&egrave;re du Cloistre</i>,
published by Francis Langlois 1646. It was one of
the symbolic and sententious works with which the
public taste is never satiated, and a kind of guide for the
priest. At the bottom of the little etching here given,
representing birds falling from a tree, we read,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div>Ceux qui n'ont rien d'esgal &agrave; ses m&oelig;urs v&eacute;n&eacute;rables."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Callot also made another set of emblems on the life
of the Virgin Mary, and published in 1620 a series
of prints in quarto for the tragedy of <i>Soliman</i> of
Bonarelli, for the account of Cecconnelli. France imposed
herself on fallen Italy, she got her works dispersed
there, and if an engraver arose there, he did not disdain
to consecrate himself to France. Witness Della Bella,
who went from Italy to France, where he was taken
under the protection of Cardinal Richelieu. It was
about the time of the establishment of the Royal
Printing House, and it was expected that employment
would be found at once for him.</p>

<p>Callot was the model chosen by the young Italian
artist, and this choice might have been less happy.
Della Bella took from his master the philosophic vein,
the drollery of design, which he exercised at first in
humorous frontispieces, among others that of Scarron's
works, where nine fish-women, taking the place of the
Muses, dance around the poet. But he passed from
gay and pleasant to severe, and made large pages of
architecture for serious titles. In 1649 he designed
the plates for the large and undigested volume of
Valdor on Louis XIII., published by Antoine Estienne
at the Royal Printing House. His success was not
there; Della Bella was a painter of groups, of ornaments,
of subjects somewhat heavy and overdrawn, but which,
after numerous transformations, opened a new way to
the vignettists of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>With Abraham Bosse the decoration of the Book
took a considerable extension. Numerous and charming
ornamented letters, heads of pages, and tailpieces
appear. There are few artists that have done so much
as he for graceful illustration and harmony between
the vignette and the printed page. His prodigious
fecundity made him attempt every style; and after the
gaieties of the print in which he laughed with his contemporaries,
he adopted a grave air to trace more severe
subjects on copper. However, the book entitled <i>La
Mani&egrave;re Universelle</i>, by Desargues, with numerous geometrical
figures and an agreeable frontispiece, bearing
the dedication to the Seigneur de Noyers, superintendent
of the Royal Printing House, was a critical
work, in which Bosse, under a serious standard, did not
spare an enemy. We do not bear ill-will to the artist,
however, for the following year he published fourteen
plates for the Suetonius printed at the Louvre.</p>

<p>He successively designed plates for the <i>Histoire de
St. Louis</i>, numerous vignettes for pious books, figures
for the <i>Pucelle</i> of Chapelain and for the <i>Larcins de la
Fortune</i>. He was always himself, refined and ingenious,
whether in the most barren or the most
complicated subjects.</p>

<p>He has left us in a celebrated print a representation

interesting page, in which is shown simply and rather

offered his books with singular eclecticism: Boccaccio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>

</div>

<p>says the text of Bosse. What was commonly done
then is still done, shopping and rummaging the stalls,
and those of the Palace were attractive.</p>

<p>If we credit Sauval, the great number of booksellers,
in the middle of the century, was due to the wits of the
Hotel de Rambouillet. The passion for novelty, for
recent works, had produced that quantity of publishers,
he says, that we have seen on the Pont Neuf, and that
we still see to-day at the Palace and the University,
but of which the number is so multiplied in all these
places that in the Palace they count more than other
dealers; and as to the neighbourhood of the University,
they are obliged, in order to lodge the rest, to
extend the ancient bounds from St. Yves to the river
(Sauval, <i>Antiquit&eacute;s de Paris</i>, viii., 354).</p>

<p>In fact, each year saw an increase in the number of
publishers in corporation, with syndicate and adjuncts.
Under the reign of Louis XIII., the single year 1610
had fifty to take rank, and among them Antoine Vitr&eacute;,
who was to become the most illustrious of his contemporaries.
But, as there were no more than six printers,
it may be inferred that all the rest were booksellers,
in the true sense of the word, of those who encumbered
afterwards the great <i>salle</i> of which Sauval speaks.
Antoine Vitr&eacute; was syndic in May, 1643, on the accession
of Louis XIV. He had four adjuncts. With him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
the Book marked the solemn style that the commencement
of the century had given to it. Royal printer
for the Oriental languages from 1621, he undertook a
Syriac work, the first that was attempted in Paris.
The project of a Polyglot Bible gave him the idea of
acquiring for the King the Oriental manuscripts and
matrices of Savary de Br&egrave;ves. The King left to him
the care of negotiating the business, but did not reimburse
him without numerous difficulties, in the midst
of which the printer was made to lose the means of
conveniently continuing his trade. The advocate Le
Jay charging himself with the enormous expenses necessitated
by the Polyglot Bible, it was composed in the
hope that Cardinal Richelieu would pay the cost. He
was willing to do so, but required that his name should
figure on the book; and as Le Jay, an independent man,
formally opposed it, Vitr&eacute; met with ill-will from the
Minister, which increased from day to day. In 1645
the impression was finished, but Le Jay was ruined, and
if we admire the paper, the type, and the extraordinary
size of the nine volumes of the Polyglot Bible, we find
in it so many faults, errors, and misprints that it has
fallen to nearly nothing, hardly being worth its binding.
There were terrible mortifications in the business, and
Vitr&eacute; had to submit to them more than any one. Nevertheless
he did not let his presses stand still, and he
published successively Arabic, Turkish, and Persian
works. His action against the Savary heirs, as representing
the King, in the acquisition mentioned above,
continued also after the impression of the Bible, and
hindered his progress. He struggled on; and the
assembly of clergy, of which he was the printer, sought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
to help him out of his difficulties. The matter being once
terminated, the Cardinal being dead, and Vitr&eacute; having
been named by Colbert director of the Royal Printing
House in place of Cramoisy, he died in his turn, and
was later accused of having destroyed the types and
matrices of the Polyglot Bible, so that they should not
be used after him. This fable, long accredited, has
since been ascertained to be false, for the punches and
matrices passed to the Royal Library, thence to the
Royal Printing House, reorganised in 1691.</p>

<p>Antoine Vitr&eacute;, in spite of his misfortunes, was a
great personage. He was painted by Champagne and
engraved by Morin, as was Richelieu himself. The
portrait was reproduced in the book of M. Delaborde,
<i>La Gravure</i> (p. 189). Such was the man whom we
meet at the beginning of the reign of Louis XIV. as
syndic of booksellers; and it was by no means a sinecure,
a canonry giving honour and profit, quite the other way.
With the Draconian rules on the subject, the syndic
assumed a heavy burden towards the King, as well as
towards his kinsmen. Religious quarrels envenomed
questions, and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes
was to have for its immediate corollary new and more
severe royal ordinances.</p>

<p>The reign of Louis XIV. saw the zenith of engraving
with the burin, but not that of printing or illustration.
Doubtless it would be puerile to pretend that
typography had not made any material progress; it
had done so in engraving and in composition; work
was done more quickly, because the presses had been
made more perfect. But the wise harmony of the old
printers, their sure taste, even in their old irregular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
blocks, was no longer there to form a graceful and
charming whole, which is to modern precision as a
picture by Van Eyck is to a chromo-lithograph. Under
Louis XIV., titles became regular, following, as we
have said above, and modelling themselves on, the
affected and peruked people who read them. All art
entered on this path of sublimity and grandeur. The
painter Le Brun is the highest exponent of this false
Olympus, where an heroic pose became necessary for the
most humble movements. Made popular by engraving
by Pesne, Audran, Poilly, Edelinck, and a hundred
others, this tendency overran everything: art and
industry, painting and tapestry, illustration and typography
itself. All was grand, in reverse of other
times, when all was small and mean. The embellishments
of the Book were full of gods in perukes and
goddesses in armour, Louis XIV. as Apollo, as the sun
illuminating the world. "Nec pluribus impar" was not
the device of one man; it was the mighty and glorious
cry of a whole people, from great to small, from the
sublime painter to the modest printer.</p>

<p>Ordinarily these exaggerations are not useful to the
arts. Here they were. But, for the matter that specially
occupies us, it does not appear that the Book was
much advanced. It approached a marvellous epoch of
a delicate and graceful art; but it did not find its form;
it dragged painfully after the Plantinian works, heavily
throwing its etchings and burins in the middle of texts,
gross and in bad taste. Yet taste in literature had an
onward tendency; Moli&egrave;re and La Fontaine produced
on their contemporaries the effect that in our day the
naturalists have produced on the romanticists; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
this was not for long. Majesty recovered its rights
with Bossuet, Boileau, and the others.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Tailpiece of Sébastien Leclerc for the
<i>Promenade de St. Germain</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>S&eacute;bastien Leclerc was one of the rare artists of the end
of the seventeenth century who dreamed of the vignette
in the midst of this invasion of pompous commonplace.
Successor of Callot in manner, induced by the publishers,
he began this style with a romance of La<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
Calpren&egrave;de, and continued with the <i>Promenade de
St. Germain</i> of Louis le Laboureur, bailie of Montmorency,
of whom Boileau said such curious things.
This is one of the rarest books of Leclerc, and we
reproduce one of the pages, with a charming tailpiece,
which comes very near those of the eighteenth
century. There was, moreover, a charm in this ingenious
designer; he adorned the works of his contemporaries
with graceful vignettes and decorations full of
suppleness. It may be believed, besides, that he did
not remain behind his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> in figure composition
or allegorical and Divine emblems. His art did not
throw off the errors of the existing school; he was content
not to copy any one and to make his works truly
his own. Such were, for example, the vignettes of the
<i>Histoire de Turenne</i>, where the heads of the chapters,
the ornamented letters, and the tailpieces, harmoniously
agree, and make the book, a little heavy in impression, a
most agreeable work. Leclerc then found himself ready
to design vignettes for the works of Racine for the publisher,
Claude Barbin, another name frequently encountered
in Boileau. The title of Vol. ii. merits attention.</p>

<p>The same year of this last publication, 1676, S&eacute;bastien
Leclerc illustrated the "Metamorphoses" of Ovid
for Benserade, the engraving of which cost the King
more than 10,000 livres. Thus adorned, the book had
not a bad appearance, but a satirist of the time, Hardin
very probably, made on it this quatrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="iquot">"Mais quant &agrave; moi j'en trouve tout fort beau:</div>
<div>Papier, dorure, images, caract&egrave;re,</div>
<div>Hormis les vers qu'il fallait laisser faire</div>
<div class="i8em">"A La Fontaine."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>It may be imagined what an engraver could produce
working from 1650 and dying in 1715, that is, a life of
work the longest that could be hoped for. Leclerc was
the absolute contemporary of the King. He died,
like him, at the beginning of the eighteenth century,
leaving work widely scattered among books, funeral
orations, and placards. After the example of Callot
and Bosse, he did not disdain satire. One of his
prettiest vignettes served to illustrate some pamphlet
of Richesource against the journalists of his time;
it represents a dandy of about 1679 offering his
gazette.</p>

<p>By the side of this unrivalled antagonist it is permitted
to place Lepautre, twenty years older than
Leclerc, but whose studies had been principally on
architecture. In the moments that he left his special
work he devoted himself to frontispieces and vignettes;
nevertheless, although he had before him the charming
designs of Leclerc, he confined himself to a cold and
hard manner, keeping, besides, as much as possible
to titles, in which his particular talent could find
scope. He designed also the Chartreux Missal of
1679, the <i>Gallia Christiana</i> after Marot, the <i>Dioptrique
Oculaire</i> of P. Ch&eacute;rubin, engraved by Edelinck, and a
thousand other works of small repute.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 78.&mdash;Small figure of Sébastien Leclerc for

</div>

<p>Very different was Francis Chauveau, who, without
having the delicacy of S&eacute;bastien Leclerc or his art
of arrangement, treated at least with grace little
figures and illustrations. Certainly there is an enormous
distance between these correct and commonplace
engraved plates and the delightful wood engravings
of the time of Geoffroy Tory, for example. But, be
their worth what it may, they suited very well; and
even with Moli&egrave;re they did not make such a bad
figure.  Chauveau was associated with many of the
works of Leclerc, who caused him often to be less
heavy, inasmuch as Leclerc corrected in engraving
many of his compositions. It was so with Moli&egrave;re,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
and still more with Racine in the plate of the <i>Plaideurs</i>,
in which Chauveau revealed himself a precursor
of the eighteenth century. Unhappily he did
not always follow this manner. Successively, and
with various luck, he illustrated <i>Alaric</i>, <i>Andromaque</i>,
and the "Metamorphoses" of Ovid for Benserade, with
Leclerc; the <i>Pucelle</i> of Chapelain, and the <i>Trag&eacute;dies</i> of
Racine, to which Le Brun did not disdain to put his
hand.</p>

<p>In short, the connecting link between the beginning
of the seventeenth and that of the eighteenth
century in the development of illustration is S&eacute;bastien
Leclerc. He had known the artists of the first period;
he was to see at his death appear one of the precursors
of the vignettists of the following century, Claude
Gillot. Thanks to him, overburdened titles and unskilful
vignettes underwent a gradual transformation. In
the delicacy and tenuity of his designs may be seen
the dominant note of the eighteenth century, coquetry,
and Choffard is divined. He was nearly the only one
who did not fall into the exaggerations of the engravers
of the time; he kept beside them without touching
them, and preciously preserved his own well-accentuated
personality. By the smallness and slenderness of his
figures, Leclerc recalls somewhat the school of Fontainebleau;
but he is above all the reflection of Callot,
a Lorrainer like himself.</p>

<p>In Holland, a Frenchman, Bernard Picart, son of
Stephen and pupil of Leclerc, was making a great
name as an illustrator. He established himself as a
print-seller at Amsterdam at the sign of "L'Etoile," and
successively designed vignettes for many works, among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
others the Boileau of 1718. His vignettes and tailpieces,
without possessing either the spirit of Leclerc
or the grace of the eighteenth century, express an
ingenious and inventive art that had broken with the
strained traditions of preceding epochs.</p>

<p>From these two artists the decoration of the Book
rapidly advanced. The form is found, and charming
designers are not wanting to apply it.</p>

<p>The troubled state of England during the greater
part of the seventeenth century no doubt accounts for
the fact that the art of the Book made but very little
progress. Theological controversies, the persecutions
by the Puritans, and, above all, the great civil war and
its antecedents and results, gave rise to a flood of
publications of an ephemeral kind, which from their
nature were hurriedly produced; and there was little
room for pure literature and art. In the early part of
the century, under the influence which Elizabeth left,
and which James fostered, some important works were
issued, with finely engraved illustrations; but wood
engraving declined further and further, until it was
artistically dead, to be revived in the next century.
The works of the numerous poets and dramatists were
printed in quarto, and collected editions of them in
folio. Thus were issued the works of Shakespeare,
first collected by Jaggard and Blount, 1623, folio, with
an engraved portrait by Droeshout, the faithfulness of
which was vouched in an opposite page of verse signed
by Ben Jonson. "Don Quixote" first appeared in an
English dress in 1612-20, published by E. Blount in
quarto; and Jaggard, Blount's partner in the Shakespeare,
published Boccaccio's "Decameron," in two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
volumes folio, 1620. Among other notable works of the
early part of the century were Drayton's "Polyolbion,"
1613; Chapman's Homer, 1611-15, folio, three volumes;
Lord Bacon, whose essays and other single publications
appeared in the seventeenth, to be collected as his
"Works" in the next century; and William Prynne,
whose <i>Histrio Mastrix</i>, 1633, so offended Charles I. by
its references to the Queen and the court ladies, that
the author had to undergo a severe and degrading
punishment. Many of these works were illustrated
with meritorious engravings on steel and copper by
W. Hollar, P. Lombart, W. Marshall, Hole, W. Pass,
W. Faithorne, and R. Vaughan. So that here were all
the materials for the foundation of an English school,
to be cruelly broken up shortly afterwards by the
distractions of civil warfare.</p>

<p>In 1611 Robert Barker first printed the Authorised
Version of the Holy Bible, which has been more often
reprinted than any other book, and which exists to
this day as the great standard of the English language.</p>

<p>The taste for books of travel which arose in the last
century was largely increased by the voyages and
discoveries of the English in North America and the
subsequent Puritan exodus there. These early accounts
of Virginia and New England, many of which are
tracts of a few leaves only, now command fabulous
prices. The great collection of voyages under the name
of "Purchas: his Pilgrimes," was printed in five folio
volumes, 1625-6, while De Bry, Hulsius, and Linschoten
were enriching the world with their collections of
travels, printed in Germany and Holland. All of these
works were adorned with finely engraved plates, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
to "Purchas" being engraved by Elstrack, and, besides,
it had a famous map of the world, engraved by Hondius.</p>

<p>The controversial spirit engendered by the religious
quarrels of the century and by the great civil war
gave incessant work to the printers; and the many
tracts and pamphlets thus produced were frequently
illustrated by rude and coarse woodcuts, of no value
from an artistic point of view, but curious from the
indications they afford of the costumes and manners
of the time.</p>

<p>The first edition of Walton's "Angler" was printed
by R. Marriott in 1653, 16mo, with plates in the text,
engraved on steel by Lombart. Butler's "Hudibras"
appeared in 1663-78, and Milton's "Paradise Lost"
in 1667, quarto. Fuller's "Worthies of England" was
printed 1662, folio. We have roughly mentioned the
principal English books of the century, and next
approach the revival of literature and art in the
eighteenth century.</p>

Artillerie</i> of Suvirey de St. Remy.</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-capi1">LIKE experience has shown us in
our time, but in another manner,
the beginning of the eighteenth
century produced, in the manners
and tastes of the French, an unconscious
but tenacious reaction.
It seemed as if the conceptions
of romanticism had lasted long
enough, and that the cycle of
Middle Age chevaliers had passed
away, and that a return to what
is called nature was effected in literature and art. At
the death of Louis XIV., Olympus and its gods, majestic
poses and suns, had become wearisome. By a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
half-open door, gaiety escaped from its prison and
fled. For the Book that door was the hand of
S&eacute;bastien Leclerc.</p>

<p>The ancient school was replaced. Constrained during
three quarters of a century, French manners began to
be joyous under the regency of the Duc d'Orleans. If
the representatives of another age still lived, if Rigaud
always painted his portraits in peruke, there were
new-comers, enlivened by the new fashions, less
solemn and more bewitching. Le Brun was then
far in the past, and as amusing to the ladies of the
regency as are now to us the fashions of the Second
Empire.</p>

<p>The Book, after its manner, followed the movement,
and gradually found the elements of its decoration in
the tendencies of the day. Small sizes were multiplied,
types showed elegance, and vignettes became
more and more agreeable and intellectual. Amateurs
had their <i>ex-libris</i> engraved. The smallest pamphlets
were covered with ornamental letters, vignettes, and
tailpieces, already very clever. Costume also, in its
shorter and lighter form, gave to designers a means
of agreeably composing a page of illustration and
disseminating fancy in the figures. These revolutions
worked themselves simply from day to day, as taste
became more pronounced and exacting.</p>

<p>The commerce of the Book was still extending from
the end of the preceding century; and if the number of
printers was limited and arrested by certain somewhat
hard laws, production in Paris was enormous. Among
regulations that weighed most heavily on publishers
figured the obligation put upon them by the ordinance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of 1713 to deposit eight copies of illustrated books. In
1725 the King issued other regulations to affirm the
rights of the university against the corporation, forcing
the masters to assist in a body at the processions of the
Sorbonne and to offer on the Day of the Purification a
candle to the rector. In spite of this ordinance, more
religious than useful to commerce, the fashion of vignettes
increased. The principal shops were searched,
as they are still, for novelties; the Rue St. Jacques and
the Quai des Augustins, where they were grouped, were
resorted to. The most important booksellers in 1727
were Coignard, the Barbous&mdash;who essayed afterwards,
with Lengley Dufresnoy, to copy the Elzevirs,&mdash;Cavalier,
Robustel, Fournier, Ballard, and D'Houry. Of
the two last, D'Houry printed the calendars, and
Ballard had the privilege for music. Another, Leonord,
published the books of the Dauphin. At these and
other publishers', recent works were examined, those
who did not buy gave their advice and took ideas, and
so fashion slowly formed itself. It was thus that
Houdart de la Motte published with G. Dupuis in 1719
a collection of fables, with illustrations of Claude Gillot,
which was the talk at the booksellers'.</p>

<p>In this book all was original: the author, who had
had, five years before, the eccentric idea of translating
the Iliad without knowing a word of Greek; the text,
a kind of imitation of La Fontaine, without salt or
savour; the size, quarto, admirably printed by Dupuis,
in the Rue St. Jacques, with plates by Coypel,
Mass&eacute;, and, above all, the charming vignettes of Gillot,
the most pleasing and clever of all his collaborators, a
sort of Callot fallen into the eighteenth century, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
ought to take the first place by birthright. Gillot has
been called, not without reason, "the last pagan of the
Renaissance;" and this pagan had the honour to give
us Watteau.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

  </a>
<p class="caption">Fig. 80.&mdash;Vignette by Gillot for the <i>Chien et le Chat</i>,
fable by Houdart de la Motte, in 1719.</p>
</div>

<p>The Count de Caylus tells the story. Gillot had
quitted the pencil for the etching needle on seeing the
work of his pupil. He had no reason to complain; his
pictures were of no value, and his prints gave other
artists the idea of imitating them. The whole French
school of the eighteenth century may have had its
origin in this forgotten book, illustrated by the master
of Watteau. In fact, in the manner of the little etching
here given we may easily perceive the coquetry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
affectation that were later the dominant tone of vignettes.
For, it may well be said, the graceful, feminine, and arch
manner of which we speak was, above all, conventional
and false. In opposition to the designers and engravers
of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
century, who reproduced naturally scenes of daily life in
ideal conceptions, it came, through the moral education
of the artists, that they put forth the ideal in the most
ordinary things of life. Shepherds were no longer the
gross, rustic peasants that we find in primitive Flemish
paintings or in the "Hours" of Simon Vostre; they
were coxcombs, pomaded and adorned with ribbons,
playing the bagpipes, and making love to the shepherdesses
of the court.</p>

<p>At first it was Watteau who influenced all the
engravers in the pretty and the smart; Boucher did the
rest; and fatally the Book followed, and followed impetuously,
surpassing, if possible, the painted works.
If the severe poses, the grave touch, of the preceding
century are no longer found, they often go a little far
in the contrary sense. It may be well said here that
the arts are ordinarily the result of the manners of an
epoch. The system of Law was not without influence
on the entire eighteenth century, by the terrible manner
in which he upset fortunes, awoke appetites, gave rein
to aspirations hitherto held in check. Claude Gillot,
the designer, was one of the first victims of the Scotch
banker; he lost his fortune on the Exchange; but who
may say what his artistic ambition dreamed of in the
midst of all these disorders? One thing is certain: that
Watteau, his pupil, broke off very short with the style
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Laurent Cars was the engraver who multiplied the
compositions of Boucher, and made them the fashion.
He engraved also, after the painter of shepherds and
nymphs, illustrations to Moli&egrave;re, the most agreeable
that there are for style and spirit. In engraving certain
works of Lemoyne, Cars did not completely desert the
ancient school. He appears at the beginning of the
eighteenth century as if divided between two manners
each equally possible to him.</p>

<p>The work of these engravers was almost exclusively in
etching, biting with acid a copper plate covered with
varnish, on which the drawing was made by means of
a point. This process, always previously used for
sketches, served also for finishing vignettes, which up
to then had been finished by the burin. The suppleness
of the work was greater, and the artist remained
more himself than he could be with the stiff cutting
instrument of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The sizes of books had not yet all come to octavo
or duodecimo. The works of Moli&egrave;re published by
Prault in 1734 in six volumes quarto, under the direction
of Marc Antoine Joly, give the idea of an important
work, not at all of theatrical pieces. To tell the truth,
these somewhat exaggerated dimensions allow artists
more room for illustration; later, when smaller forms
predominated, text and engravings were so compressed
that they were not always clear and readable to every
eye; but the quarto was not graceful, it was not in
harmony with the finikin, the pastoral pieces, then
presented, and it had to disappear as a current size in
illustrated publications.</p>

<p>The class of artisans employed on the Book is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
identical in the eighteenth century with that of printers
and publishers. In the beginning, as we have seen,
the cutters of wood blocks and the printers were often
the same people, preparing their characters or their
blocks, and afterwards putting them under the press.
Large printing offices had very quickly changed that.
Each particular work had its special workman. Typography
had its type-founders, compositors, forwarders,
inkers, and pressmen. In the eighteenth century this
was complicated by designers, engravers, plate-printers,
and these different professions occupied themselves on
the Book in manipulating the sheets in their turn. In
the midst of this crowd, the designers and engravers,
esteemed as was their collaboration, were not the most
honoured. Their homes often reflected the effect of
their life as clever artists, quick to spend the money
earned during the week; and we shall have occasion to
name some of the more miserable among them.</p>

<p>The booksellers, on the contrary, had become great
personages. In the preceding chapter we have seen
Cramoisy and Vitr&eacute;, to name only them, acquire the
greatest honours, the latter painted by Philip de Champagne,
with many others lords of the court. In the
eighteenth century there were Brunet, Ballard, Mariette,
Chardon, Didot, and a host of others, during the
time of Watteau, Boucher, and Cars, of which we shall
shortly speak; and these several publishers had houses
of their own, and furnished shops and printing offices
with the best apparatus. Saved from falling into negligences
by royal regulations on printing, they composed
with admirable characters, on paper of the first order,
imperishable works; and, usual consequence of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
high situation, they paid the artists badly charged with
their work. It would be long and tedious to enter into
this matter in detail. They made progress by slow
degrees, and in good time they marvellously united
copper plate engraving to printed text, so marvellously,
that in comparing their works to the wood blocks of
the sixteenth century, it may be asked which of the
two styles is superior in elegance and good taste.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 81.&mdash;Vignette for <i>Daphnis et Chloe</i> by Cochin, for
Coustelier's edition.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the ancestors of this group of vignettists was
the younger Cochin, who had engraved the plate of the
monks in the fables of Houdart, illustrated by Gillot.
Cochin, in spite of his passion for allegory and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
very marked taste for affectation, gave, it may be said,
with the designer-engraver St. Aubin, an enormous
impulse to the art of adorning books. From the
beginning of his career he worked for the publishers,
composing frontispieces, ornamented letters, and tailpieces,
or transferring to copper the drawings of others.
Singular type of artist, besides, educated, well brought
up, epicurean and spendthrift, friend of great lords, and
protected by Madame de Pompadour. When he travelled
in Italy with her young brother Abel Poisson, Cochin
did everything, was ready at the least request, inventing
curious menus, giving representations of f&ecirc;tes, and
yet finding the time to decorate books and design
vignettes profusely.</p>

<p>He worked chiefly for Jombert, a sort of learned
bookseller, King's printer for the artillery, who dates
from July, 1736. Jombert was visited by painters. He
gave little private soir&eacute;es, which Cochin attended,
and where he daily made numerous friends. It was
in this house, of so special a character, and, it may be
said, so little artistic at first sight, that Cochin invented
his best frontispieces, among them that of the <i>Calcul
Diff&eacute;rentiel</i>, that of the <i>Astronomie Physique</i>, and the
plates of the <i>M&eacute;thode de Dessin</i>, after Boucher. He was
one of the first to produce engraved titles, with which
the publisher Prault ornamented his dainty volumes,
and which were imitated, up to the end of the eighteenth
century, by all the illustrators who followed. In
that to the works of Madame Deshouli&egrave;res the letter
itself is engraved. Since then the open letter has been
copied in typography. These vignettes were used many
times by publishers, sometimes simply effacing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
inscription, sometimes reproducing the original design
by a different artist. The boy with the swan had
decorated in 1744 a "Jerusalem Delivered" in Italian,
by the same publisher, Prault; it was then engraved
by Aveline. Fessard engraved the second plate, which
is here reproduced.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 82.&mdash;Title-page engraved by Fessard after Cochin for
the works of Madame Deshoulières, 1747.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Nearly all the frontispieces of the Book with vignettes
of the eighteenth century preserve this arrangement:
an ornamented and draped border, with garlands of
roses, symbols, and cupids, in the middle the title, in
red and black, composed in open letter, often a scroll
with the address of the publisher, but rarely a mark.
It was the time of little winged cupids, goddesses, and
gods. The goddesses were the favourites of the kings,
Madame de Pompadour or the princesses, but rarely
the virtuous Marie Leczinska, too homely and too much
ignored to tempt the artists; the kings or the princes
were the gods.</p>

<p>After Jombert, Prault, and Coustellier, Cochin worked
for Fran&ccedil;ois Didot, syndic of the printers, for whom he
prepared a set of illustrations to Moli&egrave;re. Unfortunately
Didot died in 1757, and the project fell with him.
Of the work of Cochin there only remains the set of
<i>Tartufe</i> etchings in octavo.</p>

<p>In the vortex into which he was plunged, he successively
illustrated the works of Rousseau, published at
Brussels, quarto; those of Boileau, published by David
and Durand, octavo; and Henault's "History of France,"
in the same size, with numerous vignettes. One of these
should be noted in a book treating of printing; it is
that in which Cochin pretends to show to his contemporaries
the interior of a workshop in 1470. Without
doubt the sketch of this print was taken in one of the
houses frequented by him&mdash;at Jombert's, Didot's, or
David and Durand's&mdash;for that room in which compositors
are working and printed sheets drying was not an
invention of Cochin, and served to reproduce a printing
office of the eighteenth century.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>With Cochin soon worked a number of designers and
aqua-fortists, too prudent to lose the opportunity. The
fashion arrived for books beribboned, festooned, and
flowered. Hubert Fran&ccedil;ois Gravelot had carried to
London this style of new works, which he knew how
to decorate, in his manner, better than any one, with
letters, figures, and tailpieces. He did not engrave
much himself, leaving this work to lesser artists, and
contenting himself with subtle invention and graceful
subjects. With Eisen, Cochin, and Moreau, he is the
French artist in the sense of the time, free, bold, and
ingenious, but perhaps a little out of place in England.
He published his plates to the "Decameron" in 1757, one
of the most curious of his sets of plates, and a hundred
various vignettes. On his return to France he designed
the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i> of P. Corneille, from which the <i>Galerie de
Palais</i> is here reproduced, on account of the illustration
of bookselling which it gives. In 1764 the large <i>salon</i>
of the Palace was still, as in the time of Abraham
Bosse, a place where shops were fitted up and the new
books discussed. Side by side with the dressmakers
and merchants of every category, the bookseller offers to
his customer the recent products of Parisian presses.
Certain works were sold under cover and not shown;
there is here something to pique the curiosity of unoccupied
young men who strolled about and prolonged
their stay in the galleries.</p>

</div>

<p>Eisen has a simplicity, a good taste, and a special and
singularly perfect economy of artistic effect combined
with typography. It appears hard that the designer
had no consultative voice in the choice of impression and
disposition of the Book. The union of the two forces,
the vignette and the composition,
is so close that it may be
believed one was made for the other,
neither venturing to assert itself. In
the pretty and elaborate inventions
of the artists reigned a lackadaisical
affectation that was delightfully becoming;
the rock-work, which it still
had, suited admirably the borders
of the first page. The <i>Lettres d'une
Peruvienne</i> has a very agreeable title,
but little different, on the whole, from
that of Madame Deshouli&egrave;res, by
Cochin. It is the same with the
<i>Lettres Turques</i>, published at Amsterdam
in 1750, and generally in all
the frontispieces signed by him. As
to the other decorations of the Book,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
there were also a number of ingenious artists, confusing
cupids and flowers, imposing blazons, delighting
in playing with accumulated difficulties. Under this
assuredly involuntary but real direction, publications
attained proportions of luxury and coquetry until then
unknown. The volume of <i>Baisers</i> of Dorat would not
have lived but for Eisen and the delightful fancies with
which he adorned it.</p>

<p>At the same time, we find Choffard, another designer
and etcher of much repute, and sought after by the
booksellers. Under his pencil the vignette became a
<i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>, the tailpiece was a delightful compound of
judicious and sportive ornament, the taste for which
grew more and more. From delicate foliage are suspended
roses, shepherds' pipes, lyres, and zithers.
With the zephyrs scrolls or ribbons float, carried by
winged cupids. The initial letters are real pictures,
of such fineness and precision that the difficulties of
their reproduction prevent us from putting them before
the reader.</p>

<p>When the <i>fermiers g&eacute;n&eacute;raux</i>, those great amateur
financiers of the last century, conceived the idea of an
edition of the <i>Contes</i> of La Fontaine at their expense,
their eyes naturally fell upon the artists best prepared
to illustrate the inimitable fancies of the great poet,
Eisen and Choffard. The first had for his task the composition
of the plates, Choffard the general decoration.
Ficquet was added for the portrait of the <i>bonhomme</i> La
Fontaine&mdash;Ficquet, whose specialty in this <i>genre</i> was
dazzling in its delicacy and spirit; Diderot wrote a short
introduction; the composition was confided to a printer
of the first order, and it was put on sale by Barbou.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not a book to be recommended from a moral
point of view, but the typographical art, joined to that
of designers and engravers, never obtained a more complete
success: the size in octavo, the impression clear,
united with the dimensions of the plates in a harmonious
elegance, well calculated to please the three rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
personages and the joyous amateurs to whom the
<i>Contes</i> address themselves. True, Eisen has dressed
the greater part of the characters in the costume of his
time, which is a little hurtful to one's feelings to-day;
it may be imagined, however, that it was La Fontaine
who was mistaken, so that these delicate, risky tales
appear to be created for the seigneurs of the time of
Louis XV.</p>

<p>All the special literature sought for then by rich
people had not the value of the <i>Contes</i>. There was at
Rheims a person, who has to-day become the <i>mode</i>, as he
was in the time of Louis XVI., who sold under cover a
quantity of licentious books of the better kind, adorned
with figures by Eisen, Marillier, or Cochin; this was
Cazin, an artist in his way, but whose good name
suffered under a scandalous trial. An order of the
Council of State in 1764 enjoined him to cease his trade
in the Place Royale at Rheims, where he sold his
particular merchandise. It appears that the sentence
was not without appeal, for we find Cazin at Paris
about 1785. He was one of those who were ruined
by the Revolution, after he had popularised the
editions known as <i>Petits Formats</i>, printed by Valade, of
Paris.</p>

<p>We have come to the most beautiful illustrated books
of the eighteenth century, and to the illustrious artists
of whom we shall speak in good time should be added
the younger Moreau and St. Aubin, the former nephew
by marriage of the publisher Prault, and therefrom a
decorator of the Book, the other thrown by Gravelot
into full work, and rapidly becoming the most subtle
and adroit of the etchers of the time. Moreau did not
wait long after his marriage before setting to work. He
began with ornaments destined for the <i>Histoire de France</i>
of President Henault; then he composed, in his own
personal manner, titles and tailpieces for his uncle. In
the Book he is the propagator of garlands of roses, which
he grouped with an ideal grace; he twined them in the
borders of his frontispieces, and put them judiciously
in his tailpieces. He excelled in inventing subjects
referring to the text which were not commonplace
ornaments suitable for anything. The tailpiece on
p. 202, taken from the works of Moli&egrave;re, brings forcibly
to mind the <i>M&eacute;decin malgre Lui</i>, with its wood-cutter
unmercifully beaten with sticks and muffled in a scientific
robe. It is the same with other illustrations, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
cannot be displaced from the position assigned to them
by the artist without disappointment.</p>

<p>The year 1773, which saw the publication by De
Bret of the works of Moli&egrave;re, may perhaps be considered
as that in which the French Book of the eighteenth
century reached its culminating point. M. de Laborde,
first valet de chambre of the King and governor of the
Louvre, published with De Lormel, printer to the
Academy of Music, his celebrated collection of <i>Chansons</i>,
dedicated to the young Dauphiness Marie Antoinette,
and partly illustrated by the younger Moreau. The work
is exquisite, of powerful yet simple grace. The sentimental
note of the century was struck in it, the insipid
love of shepherdesses there tenderly sighed, and the
designer has delightfully rendered this arch side of the
pastoral song.</p>

<p>Our task does not permit us to linger over the works
of this prodigious and charming artist, but we must mention
his inimitable plates to J. J. Rousseau, the finest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and most agreeable of his compositions and vignettes,
also his <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>, the <i>Histoire du Costume</i>.</p>

<p>Doubtless some of these ascriptions are for frontispieces
only, but as a list of the principal book illustrators
of the time, and as showing the measure of
their popularity, this table is of much interest.</p>

<p>With the Revolution the decline of the Book arrives,
as that of all the arts. Moreau, friend of David, had
become affected by the new ideas and the burlesque
renaissance of Greek and Roman art. He made his
apology on the altar of the gods, and engraved portraits
on wood to punish himself for having painted the
elegancies of fallen tyrants. At this game, nerve, as
well as suppleness, was lost; and if he had had only
the artistic knack of the Revolution, his daughter,
married to Charles Vernet, could not have written of
him, "That which can be most admired is, at the
same time, the fecundity and flexibility of Moreau's
talent, that marvellous facility of conceiving a picturesque
scene and disposing it in an interesting and
truthful manner in the least extended space." This
was true before, but after?</p>

<p>In spite of his passion for the ideas and men of the
Revolution, Moreau found himself at the end of his
resources. Renouard, the publisher, received him as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
he had received St. Aubin, to whom he advanced sum
after sum to prevent him dying of hunger. Like
most of his contemporaries, Moreau, pressed by want,
"took, quitted, and retook the cuirass and the hair-shirt."
He had drawn for everybody: for Louis XVI.,
for the Republic, for Napoleon I.</p>

<p>The worst of it is that after his designs for Ovid,
Moli&egrave;re, and Rousseau, dating from the reign of
Louis XVI., he should have done them again in 1804,
1806, and 1808. The difference was great, even probably
for his publishers, Renouard and Dupr&eacute;el. It
does not appear that the pontiff of the new school,
David, knew of his distress; and Moreau succumbed
in 1814 to a cancerous scirrhus of the right arm, forgotten
and in the greatest misery.</p>

<p>We have passed a little quickly to the end of the
century because it is of no importance to name each of
the publishers and artists, but only to sketch briefly
their tastes or their manner. We have not dwelt long
on the engravers so called, because of their number;
but their dexterity remains proverbial; they handled
etching with extreme suppleness, and often interpreted
the drawings of illustrators in remitting them to the
needle. Many of these, not to say all, made use themselves
of the etching needle, St. Aubin for example, who
knew how to give to the work of others his personal
mark and distinction.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>The Revolution passed over some among those
that it ruined, and, as stated above, they followed the
movement, and lost themselves in the school of David.
It was Duplessis-Bertaux who, after having furnished
to Cazin, the publisher, vignettes for his <i>Recueil des
Meilleurs Contes en Vers</i>, 1778, and many other books,
after having worked for Didot, devoted himself to
patriotic engraving and to the reproduction of scenes
of the Revolution. When he published his <i>Tableaux
Historiques</i>, in three volumes folio, adorned with nearly
two hundred large plates, it was under the Consulate,
that is to say far from the time when the work was
begun. Renouvier assures us, with his exclusive disdain
for the eighteenth century, that Duplessis-Bertaux was a
mystifier, and that his scenes of the Revolution were
a hoax, "in the kind of spirit in vogue under the
Directory." The truth is that the artist, in place of
being a cheerful Callot, as might be thought from his
manner of engraving, so like that of the Lorraine artist,
was imbued with the emphatic and exaggerated impressions
of the first Republic, its <i>sans-culottes</i> in the poses
of the Sabines and its <i>tricoteuses</i> apeing Penelope.</p>

<p>The immense artistic advance made in France in
the eighteenth century in the manufacture and illustration
of the Book made itself felt throughout Europe.
In Germany, Chodowiecki, born at Dantzic of a family
of apothecaries, developed his talent from ornamenting
the boxes of his father, and from 1758 to 1794 he
designed numerous plates for books and almanacs,
a little heavy in engraving, but singularly clever in
composition. There were a few others also designing,
and Kilian, Folkema, and Ridinger produced some fine
engravings, but the Book did not make so much progress
in Germany as in France and England.</p>

<p>In England a vast improvement was manifested.
Fine types were cast by Baskerville and Caslon; printing
machines were perfected. The illustration of books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
by engraved plates was in the first half of the century
almost entirely done by foreigners, but an English
school was arising, which attained perfection in the
latter half of the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth
century. Wood engraving also, which, with
the exception of blocks for head and tailpieces, had
become almost a lost art, was revived by Bewick, to
become later one of the chief adornments of the Book.</p>

<p>Before 1716 English printers obtained their best
founts of type from Holland, but the establishment
of the Caslon foundry rendered them independent.
William Caslon, the first great English type-founder,
was born 1692, and died 1766. The foundry still exists,
pre-eminent in the beauty of its characters. Baskerville
established a foundry about 1750, and printed at
Birmingham with his own types a number of extremely
beautiful books. The impetus given to fine printing
by these two men rapidly spread itself, and laid the
foundation of the perfection which English book-making
reached.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Gravelot illustrated many
English books in the early part of the century. He
designed a set of plates to Shakespeare in 12mo,
1740, and another in quarto, 1744, besides numerous
frontispieces and other plates in all kinds of books.
Among other foreigners who engraved for English
publishers were Grignion, Kip, Van der Gucht, Houbraken,
and Bartolozzi. Bartolozzi, who was very prolific
in the production of engraved plates, may perhaps
be called the founder of that great English school of
engraving which arose with the establishment of the
Royal Academy in 1769 and the encouragement given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
by Alderman Boydell. Houbraken and Vertue engraved
a set of fine portraits in folio for Rapin's
"History of England," 1736; William Hogarth designed
plates for Butler's "Hudibras," 1744; and
among other curiosities of English engraving before
1750 were Sturt's edition of the Common Prayer,
entirely engraved on copper plates, 1717, and an
edition of Horace entirely engraved by Pine, 1733.
That the taste for illustrated books soon grew to be
great is evidenced by the publication of such expensive
works as Boydell's edition of Shakespeare, in nine
volumes folio, commenced in 1791, and adorned with
a hundred plates from pictures specially commissioned
by the spirited publisher; Claude's <i>Liber Veritatis</i>, with
three hundred engravings by Richard Earlom 1777,
Sir Robert Strange's engravings of fifty historical
prints about 1750, collections of views in Great Britain
by Kip, Buck, and Boydell; Holbein's "Collection of
Portraits" 1792, a hundred and fifty plates to
Shakespeare engraved by S. and E. Harding 1793,
all of which cost great sums to produce, and greatly
contributed to the elevation of public taste. Among
the artists of the latter half of the century who contributed
to the decoration of the Book are Thomas
Stothard, whose very beautiful designs, extending into
the next century, excelled those of all his contemporaries
in their grace and spirit; Robert Smirke, best known by
his plates for Shakespeare, "Don Quixote," and "Gil
Blas;" Burney; and Richard Westall. It may be said
generally that the English books of the eighteenth century
were of a more solid character than the French,
although English art, especially in the decoration of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Book, owes much to French initiation. It is curious
to read now the opinion of a contemporary French
engraver on English art. Choffard, in the preface
to Basan's <i>Dictionnaire</i> 1767, wrote, "They" (the
English), "having been supported by some foreign
talent, are trying to create talent among themselves;
but they have not seized the flame of genius that
vivifies all art in France."</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;Tailpiece engraved on wood by John Baptist
Papillon (before 1766).</p>
</div>

<p>However, what had become of engraving by cutting
in reverse, the figure in relief, from which printing
could be done? It had, we may think, nearly disappeared
in the midst of the continued invasion of the
burin and etching. It only appeared from time to time
in head and tailpieces, remaining purely typographical
and lost in other decorations. There were always
wood engravers, not very clever, capable only of working
simple lines without charm. One of them resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
to resuscitate the art, and made various attempts about
the end of the reign of Louis XIV. and beginning of
that of Louis XV. He was named John Papillon, and
was born at St. Quentin in 1661. His experiments
did not go beyond a book of prayers, with thirty-six
figures in relief after S&eacute;bastien Leclerc. His son, John
Baptist, succeeded him, and continued to engrave
without ceasing subjects of ornament, letters, often
tailpieces, of a good style upon the whole, and taking
an excellent place in an elaborate book. Unfortunately,
grace had fled; the processes that the practitioners
exhibited one after the other were lost; and the
Papillons reconstituted, we may say, a vanished art.
John Baptist also published in 1766 a theoretical
treatise on wood engraving, abounding in historical
errors, but in which something to learn may be found
if taken with discernment. He says in his preface,
"Now that excellent work is done on copper, wood
engraving is neglected, and the use lost of designing
and cutting the shadows of the pencil on the wood
block; most of those who work in it have neither design
nor taste, and only follow their own ideas; it is not
astonishing that only very mediocre pieces come from
their hands, to say nothing stronger; the profound
ignorance of nearly all who meddle with it contrives
more and more to destroy the beauties of this art in
which many people find neither pleasure nor grace.
To obviate all this, if it be possible to me, I have undertaken
to give my precepts and observations to those
who wish to apply themselves to my engraving."</p>

<p>It was probably the essays of Papillon that provoked
curious experiments on the part of other wood engravers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Duplat, at the beginning of this century, proposed to
prepare a relief on stone, and as this would be broken
under pressure, he invented a mould; that is to say,
he took a leaden matrix from the stone cutting, and
ran a resistant metal into this mould, thus obtaining
a relief similar to the stone. Renouard, the publisher,
made the trials; and the younger Moreau made the
designs. Moreau become an essayer of processes in
1811! One of the plates of La Fontaine's <i>Fables</i>,
published by Renouard in 1812, in two volumes, 12mo,
is here reproduced.</p>

</div>

<p>It appears, however, that the publisher was thwarted
by bad printing. The printers of Didot or Mame,
much as they consecrated all their care to it, did not
yet know perfect workmanship; they put the most
intense blacks into fine sheets. The great publishers
trusted that better days would leave to more clever
men the task of perfecting the invention.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 92.&mdash;Portrait of Thomas Bewick.</p>
</div>

<p>Wood engraving owes its revival and almost perfection
in England to Thomas Bewick, who published
his first work in 1770, his "General History of Quadrupeds"
1790, and his "Birds" 1797. In these works
he not only depicted his subjects with the most scrupulous
fidelity, but in the tailpieces of the several chapters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
he drew the most quaint, humorous, and faithful
representations of country life. He, with his brother,
John Bewick, and their pupils, among whom was Luke
Clennell, had an influence upon English art and the
decoration of the Book in England which exists to our
day. Not alone with us, for he may be said to have
repaid the debt which we owed to France for her
illustrated books of the eighteenth century by stimulating
the art of wood engraving, which was practised
by Tony Johannot and the other illustrators of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>To return to the eighteenth century, with which this
chapter is specially occupied, we have said that the Royal
Printing House, after various fortunes, still existed;
and in 1788 it worked, for better or for worse, at the
Louvre. According to the budget of that year, it cost
the King 90,000 livres, of which the director had 1,400.</p>

<p>There were, on the other hand, a certain number of
official printing offices, that of war, for example, which
was devoted entirely to the work of the Ministry. It
was situated at Versailles, and was created in 1768. It
is told of Louis XV. that, being one day in this
workshop, he found a pair of spectacles, left as if in
inadvertence on a printed sheet. As his sight was
weakening, he took the spectacles and looked through
them. The sheet was a hyperbolical eulogium composed,
as if at random, by the director Bertier, in
honour of the King. Louis XV., having read the
dithyramb, replaced the spectacles, and quietly said,
"They are too strong; they make objects too large."</p>

<p>Who would believe that at the end of the century
of Voltaire and Rousseau a craftsman would be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
desirous of leading back the typographical art to its
cradle, and of making xylographs again, under the
name of polytypes? A German was the original who
conceived the plan. He obtained an order of council for
the establishment of his presses in 1785, but the same
council suppressed them 1st November, 1787. His
process was to substitute for movable characters a
plate of fixed letters, and probably engraved.</p>

<p>Another eccentricity of typography at the end of the
century was the introduction of "logography" by John
Walter, the proprietor and printer of the <i>Times</i> newspaper,
which consisted in casting whole the words in
most common use, in place of separate letters. The
system had soon to be abandoned, but the early numbers
of the <i>Times</i>, which was started January 1st, 1785, were
printed on it.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century there was a printing establishment
for each of the constituted bodies; the King,
the Queen, the princes, each had their own. The royal
lottery occupied a special printing house.</p>

<p>The young inmates of the blind asylum worked
under the direction of M. Clousier, royal printer.
Louis XVI. authorised the celebrated Ha&uuml;y, their
master, to allow them to print; and in 1786 they composed
an essay on the education of the blind. Pierre
Fran&ccedil;ois Didot was in 1785 printer to the Prince,
afterwards Louis XVIII.; and he published the
<i>Aventures de T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>, in two quarto volumes, from
this special printing office.</p>

<p>The English colonies in North America early established
printing there, their first book, the "Book of
Psalms," known as the Bay Psalm Book, being dated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
1640. By the middle of the eighteenth century literature
held a strong position in the colonies, the greater
part of it being, as might be expected, English; but the
revolution and subsequent establishment of the United
States created a national American literature, which has
flourished to this day. Among the printers of North
America in the eighteenth century, the most famous
was the celebrated philosopher Dr. Benjamin Franklin,
who served his apprenticeship to the printing press in
London. He returned to America in 1726, and worked
as a printer with his brother at Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1">POLITICAL imitators had not been
found for the French Revolution
in all the neighbouring countries
of Europe, but its Greco-Roman
art established itself, and by
degrees was introduced into the
studios of painters and the printing
offices. Prud'hon, Gerard, Girodet, and later
Desenne, without counting the younger Moreau and
his contemporaries of the older regime, rallied to the
new study, forming a school of illustrators and vignettists
with which the publishers could resolutely advance.
England followed suit with Flaxman, West,
Fuseli, Barry, and a crowd of others. Among the
publishers the powerful family of the Didots took first
rank, and its members, at once type-founders, printers,
booksellers, and <i>savants</i> of the first order, were the
best fitted to direct an artistic and literary movement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
When Napoleon crowned himself emperor of the French,
the elders of the family had already brought about a
number of perfections and discoveries in their profession
by which their workshops had profited. Fran&ccedil;ois
Ambroise, who died in the year of the Empire, had
given an exact proportion to types, a free and elegant
turn, but perhaps too regular and precise to be agreeable.
He had also invented a press called the <i>presse
&agrave; un coup</i>, in which the impression was taken by a
single pull instead of being produced by a series of
successive strikings. His brother, Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois,
spoken of in the preceding chapter, was a type-founder
and paper-maker at Essones, and counted among his
official titles "printer to the Comte de Provence," as
Fran&ccedil;ois Ambroise was to the Comte d'Artois.</p>

<p>Of these two branches equally faithful to typography,
Pierre Didot, son of Fran&ccedil;ois Ambroise, became the
head on the death of his father. Born in 1760, he
had studied his art with passion, and had merited the
installation of his workshops in the Louvre, where
he published a celebrated collection known as the
Louvre editions, the <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of which was the
works of Racine. The splendid execution of this book,
in three large folio volumes, was a true typographical
revolution. Never in any country had scrupulous
perfection of detail been joined to so masterly a knowledge
of disposition and form of characters. The great
artists of the Davidian school had the honour of seeing
their drawings reproduced as illustrations, and those
named above designed the fifty-seven plates with which
the edition was adorned. Pierre Didot displayed a
great affectation in only printing two hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
copies of his irreproachable and marvellous work, of
which a hundred had proofs of the plates before letters.
Published by subscription, the ordinary edition was
issued at 1,200 francs, and with proofs 1,800 francs.</p>

<p>To these superb works Firmin Didot, his brother,
added ingenious discoveries. Struck with certain difficulties
of printing as well as of correction, he imagined
the welding together of the types of a forme, when
once obtained without faults, so as to avoid the trouble
of new composition. This process, useless for books of
small number, had a capital importance in the case of
reimpressions of popular and successful works. He
named this method stereotype, and from 1799 he
published a Racine in 18mo by this method; but the
originality of the method, which he was the first to
call stereotype, ended with its name, for the process had
already been discovered by William Ged, a goldsmith of
Edinburgh, in 1725, the first book produced in this
manner being an edition of Sallust, printed in 1744,
8vo, "non typis mobilibus ut vulgo fieri solet, sed
tabellis seu laminis fusis, excudebat."</p>

<p>This admirably directed house, we may indeed say
this school of typography, formed with Renouard,
Claye, Rignoux, and others, the greater number of the
French publishers of the middle of the century. When
the Czar Alexander went to Paris, he wished to do
honour to the greatest French practitioners in the
science of printing, in the persons of the brothers
Pierre and Firmin Didot. But these were not the
only ones. The sons of Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois, Henri and
Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois II.&mdash;the latter specially applied himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
to paper-making, under the name of Didot St. Leger&mdash;followed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">in the footsteps of their father and uncle.</span><br />
Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois made at Essones an excellent paper,
which he brought to the perfection of making it in
endless rolls, such as are made to-day for rotary
machines. Bernardin de St. Pierre retired to Essones
about the end of the last century, and there married the
daughter of Pierre Fran&ccedil;ois II. It is a curious coincidence
that the same village contained at once the man
whose works at the beginning of the century had so
extraordinary a success and the great family of printers
who had given definitive impetus to typographical
work. It was in this tranquil circle that the author
of "Paul and Virginia," at the age of sixty, sought repose;
that the publication of his book was resolved upon
with all the luxury due to its success, with admirable
type and with plates by Prud'hon and others. He
added to it the <i>Chaumi&egrave;re Indienne</i>, written in 1790,
on the eve of the Terror, which is one of the most
delicate novels of the time.</p>

<p>The homely and sweet literature of Bernardin de St.
Pierre, the heroic inventions of Girodet, Gerard, and
Chaudet in the Greek or Roman style, the clever but
severe typography of the Didots&mdash;such is the composition
of the Book at the beginning of the century,
and also its avowed tendency and good taste. Under
Louis XV. the nymphs carried panniers; Polyeucte had
peruke and sword. It would be unbecoming not to give
Juno or Venus the head-dress adopted in paintings and
vignettes. At the time which now occupies us fashion
in clothing directed designers also. The hair of goddesses
was <i>&agrave; la Titus</i>; the waist was under the arms;
golden circles were on the brow. Simple mortals walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
naked on the roads, with plumed casques and superb
shields. There were heroes putting forth their disproportioned
arms, others raising their eyes to heaven in
impossible attitudes. Such were all the vignettes, from
Girodet to the humblest, the last, the most forgotten.</p>

<p>It happens, by an oddity of which the cause is vainly
sought, that this classic and revolutionary school of
David identifies itself so well with the Napoleonic
epoch, then with the people of the Restoration, that
it seems expressly made for them. At the same
time, under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. the Romans
and Greeks had not the bold carriage of their early
days; they became more citizenised, and assumed the
air of the national guards of the kingdom of which later
an excessive use was made.</p>

<p>England also had a splendid series of publishers and
printers. From Boydell, Harding, the Murrays, Fisher;
from Bulmer, Bensley, Strahan, the Whittinghams,
and Hansard, to our day, there has been an unbroken
and constantly increasing line of clever, practical men,
adorning the professions to which they devoted their
energies, often realising that fortune which properly
directed energies command. In the first half of the
century a vast number of splendidly printed books
were issued, ornamented in the most lavish manner
with beautiful illustrations, engraved on steel or copper
plates, and with delicate woodcuts. Book illustration
in England may be said now to have reached perfection.
When the banker-poet Samuel Rogers wished to bring
out an illustrated edition of his works, he employed
the two most capable artists of the time, Thomas
Stothard and J. M. W. Turner; and they produced an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
admirable series of designs, which were exquisitely
engraved by Finden, Goodall, and Pye. The work
was printed by T. Davidson, in two volumes, octavo:
the "Italy" in 1830 and the "Poems" in 1834; these
two volumes, from the perfect harmony of the typography
and illustration and their combined beauty,
may be referred to as the perfection of book-making.
A very charming series of volumes is found in the
"Annuals," "Keepsakes," "Amulets," and similar
annual publications, illustrated with beautiful steel plates
by the best engravers. The splendidly printed and
illustrated bibliographical works of Dr. T. F. Dibdin
may also be mentioned. They extend to several
volumes, and were printed by Bulmer and his successors
Nicoll and T. Bensley, illustrated by engraved plates
and woodcuts by F. C. Lewis and others. H. G. Bohn,
besides the fine series known as "Bohn's Libraries,"
numbering over six hundred volumes, in every branch
of literature, art, and science, published many finely
illustrated books, and as a bookseller had the largest
stock of his day. Charles Knight did marvels in
popularising literature in his day. William Pickering
published a long series of very beautiful books, and in
conjunction with Charles Whittingham, printer, of the
far-famed Chiswick Press, revived the Aldine or old-faced
types; one of the most beautiful of his publications
was Sir Harris Nicolas's edition of Walton's
"Angler," in two volumes, imperial octavo, with a very
fine set of steel plates, designed by Stothard and
engraved by Augustus Fox and W. J. Cooke, besides
engraved vignettes and representations of fish drawn
by Inskipp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>In Germany perhaps the most remarkable achievement
of the century is the extraordinary series of
volumes of English authors, now (1887) numbering
2,500, issued by Baron Tauchnitz, of Leipzig, which,
although eminently popular in their character, are well
and tastefully printed. Among the most notable of the
printing and publishing houses of Germany, many of
them combining the two trades, are J. G. Cotta, dating
from 1640; Breitkopf and H&auml;rtel, dating from 1719;
Justus Perthes, founded 1796; T. O. Weigel, 1797; F.
A. Brockhaus, 1805; B. G. Teubner, 1811; W. Drugulin,
1829; J. J. Weber, 1834, etc. Germany has advanced
with England and France in fine typography and illustration
in their several kinds. The modern school of book
illustration in Germany undoubtedly has its origin in
the influence given to it by the designs of the artist
Adolph Menzel, amongst which a series of two hundred
illustrations to the works of Frederick the Great, engraved
on wood by the Vogels, Unzelman and M&uuml;ller,
show him to be one of the most powerful and accurate
draughtsmen of the century.</p>

<p>To return to France, a new literature arose that
was to react against the Greek full of Gallicisms; but
the movement, in reversing the ancient state of things,
in wishing to replace antiquity by the Middle Ages, old
Romans by old French, completely changed the physiognomy
of the Book. The engraved vignette and the
copper plate of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
were to lose their supremacy and to give way to etching
and wood engraving, also a revival of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 93.&mdash;Wood engraving by Clennell after West, for the
diploma of the Highland Society.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not sufficiently known that wood engraving,
after the unfortunate attempts of Papillon in France,
was restored in England by Thomas Bewick, who
founded a school, of which, at the commencement of
our century, Clennell and the brothers Thompson were
members. One of the Thompsons went to France
about the middle of the Restoration, doubtless with the
hope of profiting by his art, and he offered to the Print
Department of the National Library
the diploma of the Highland Society, a
large folio wood block, very adroit and very curiously
cut, after the drawing of the celebrated Benjamin
West, and copied from Clennell's original block
of the same subject. M. Duchesne, then Keeper of
the Prints, speaks of this last process as of an apparition:
"This print makes apparent the long-neglected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
and often reappearing art of wood engraving,
which, though it could never equal copper engraving,
nevertheless merits the attention of amateurs when a
capable hand is exercised upon it." It was, we see, a
curiosity then, this relief cutting, of which the resurrection
was to give an enormous impulse to the Book from
the facilities of printing and the economies realised by
the possibility of intercalation in periodicals. In fact,
metal printing necessitated so much trouble, more for
engraving than for the impression. With wood blocks
surrounded by type the ordinary press sufficed. The
<i>Magasin Pittoresque</i>, which was commenced in 1833, and
the success of which from the first was very great,
was born of these new combinations. Before it the
<i>Messager Boiteux</i> of Strasbourg and other popular
almanacs progressed very well with their illustrations
on wood. A kind of firm of engravers, at the head of
which were Best and Andrew, undertook the illustrations
of the <i>Magasin Pittoresque</i>. In a few years progress
was immense, other publications came into existence,
and a definitive return was made to the vignette in
relief. The French illustrated paper preceded our
<i>Illustrated London News</i> by nine years.</p>

<p>Lavish use was now made of wood engraving, which
had thus been suddenly revived in the very midst of
the new romantic effervescence, amid a war of books,
which, in order to please, had above all to captivate the
eye, reacting at once against the spirit and the art of
the Restoration. Never before had artists to such an
extent taken active part in a purely literary warfare.
All the fantastic tendencies of young France were
embodied in the lame and halting lines of the time and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
similar wretched doggerel. Doubtless the leaders of the
school did not go quite so far, and their reputation even
suffered from such theories; but, as always happens
in such cases, the disciples outstripped their masters.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 94.&mdash;Vignette by Devéria for the <i>Fiancé de la
Tombe</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The brothers Johannot were the first to join in the
fray, under the flag of the poets and others of the
romantic school, such as Victor Hugo, De Vigny, Paul
Lacroix, George Sand, and Dev&eacute;ria, most ruthless of
illustrators. The last-named had designed vignettes
on wood, of all others, for Baour-Lormian, that is to
say for the foe of the new ideas, at once the interpreter
of Ossian and the bourgeois bard, full of fire and fury
against everything in turn. The <i>L&eacute;gendes, Ballades,
et Fabliaux</i>, illustrated by Dev&eacute;ria in 1829, although
a sort of compromise with the lovesick swains of
medi&aelig;val times, did not escape the shafts of ridicule.</p>

<p>In the midst of this movement the Book became
democratic; it was printed on sugar-paper for reading-rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
and scullery maids. The generation of romancists
diffused its paper-covered works, printing a thousand
copies and selling five hundred with great difficulty.
Poets publishing five hundred were happy with a sale
of two hundred and fifty. Unheard-of titles were then
needed to catch the eye, ridiculous and ghastly frontispieces
to tickle the fancy of the riffraff. Paul Lacroix
called himself the "Bibliophile Jacob," and invented
surprising headpieces and foolish designs. And then,
as in the fifteenth century, as in the old times, certain
signs become popular with the reading public. In the
place of the Doctrinals, Complaints, and Disputes, so
common in the titles of those epochs, new fancies
spring up and have their day. Eccentric devices
recommend romantic trash, in which the assassin's
dagger, blood, and the horrors of the tomb have replaced
the insipid fantasies of the fallen regime. P&eacute;trus
Borel, the werewolf, a sort of historic ghoul prowling
about the graveyards, enjoyed a monopoly, as it were,
of the ghastly titles and contents of this charnel-house
literature; it was for his <i>Champavert</i>, published in
1833, that Gigoux composed a kind of Bluebeard
surrounded by female skeletons, that opened the eyes
of publishers to his value as a vignettist.</p>

<p>Although he threw himself soul and body into the
romantic movement, the young artist did not alone
design subjects called "abracadabrants," following the
neologism of the time, any more than the booksellers
only published romances. An attempt was made, by
publishing them in parts, to still further popularise
the old writers at all harmonising with the current
taste. The publisher Paulin thus issued the <i>Gil Blas</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
of Le Sage, with illustrations in the text by the
younger Gigoux, of which the best was hoped. The
history of this celebrated enterprise has been written
by the artist himself in the curious <i>Causeries</i> published
recently by him, fifty years after his work on Gil Blas;
and this interesting view of an epoch already far distant
gives us in a few words the ordinary economy of
these popular impressions in parts.</p>

  </a>
<p class="caption">Fig. 95.&mdash;Vignette by John Gigoux for <i>Gil Blas</i>.</p>
</div>


<p>It appears that Paulin, publisher in the Rue de Seine,
not being very well off, had associated himself with a
man of business named Dubochet, who had before made
an enormous fortune with gas. The two represented
fifteen thousand to twenty thousand francs, and they
ordered a hundred drawings on wood from the young
artist. He set to work with precaution, for Dubochet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
was hard to please, without knowing much about the
business, and fined the engravers for the least faults.
Gigoux set himself to give his compositions in simple
line, without complicated shadows, so as to allow the
wood-cutters to preserve a free outline. It was nearly
the same thing as the process of the old artists of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, of Vostre and Holbein:
true engraving in relief. The success of the first sheets
was extraordinary; new vignettes were ordered from
Gigoux; in place of a hundred they wanted three
hundred, then four hundred; then at the end of the
work they counted six hundred at least. Money filled
the chests of the firm, but when the artist claimed a
small share of the benefits, they laughed in his face.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, it was the first serious attempt at
illustration by the recovered method of engraving in relief,
but it was not the only one. Curmer, the publisher
of the Rue Richelieu, prepared a Bible in 1835 and
several other volumes, among which were the "Paul and
Virginia" and the <i>Chaumi&egrave;re Indienne</i> of Bernardin de
St. Pierre. He had also collected around him a circle of
artists that included Wattier, Dev&eacute;ria, and Meissonier,
who was the most perfect and correct of the designers
on wood. Meissonier designed very soberly, without
effects of light, little scenes admirably cut by an engraver
named Lavoignat, a master in the largest sense of the
word. Curmer wrote in 1835 in the preface to one of
his books, "We hope we have raised a monument to
wood engraving. It is easy to judge of the resources
presented by this art. We are compelled to have
recourse to England to accomplish our work. Peace
to willing publishers!"</p>

  </a>
<p class="caption">Fig. 96.&mdash;Vignette by Daumier for the <i>Cholera à Paris</i></p>
</div>

<p>Curmer acknowledges the importance of English
specialists in this new process for vignettes, and the
willing publishers were not wanting; they came from
all parts. He himself did not stop on the way; he
continued his work on a large scale; and Charles
Blanc was able to say of him later, as well as of Furne,
"He desired to illustrate books for everybody, as the
great booksellers of the last century had illustrated
their rare editions for a small number of privileged
persons." But he did not always confine himself to
wood engraving; he also employed etching and lithography.
These, requiring separate printing, did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
make intercalation with the text any easier than engraving
with the burin; but they served to illustrate
periodicals, the <i>Charivari</i> and <i>L'Artiste</i>, as well as
some books, where they replaced the engraved plates
of the preceding century. At the same time, the latter
process was not altogether neglected; about 1840 it
was revived, and steel was used in place of copper, as
it better resisted repeated impressions. The publisher
Furne, while he employed wood engraving, adorned
with separate plates on steel his better publications.
For him worked Raffet, one of the romanticists
enamoured of the Napoleonic epic, which he had
popularised, with Charlet and Bellang&eacute;, by the pencil,
wood, and lithography. Raffet had transferred upon
wood, as if in play, the three hundred and fifty-one
vignettes of the <i>Histoire de Napol&eacute;on</i>, by De Norvins,
which would to-day suffice for the glory and reputation
of many artists. In fact, the analytical and inductive
spirit of the artist led him to leave nothing to the
chances of inspiration and commonplace of illustration.
He laboriously reconstituted, fragment by fragment,
the physiognomy of the "old army;" and imbued with
the perfect science of detail, he allowed his pencil full
play in bold and luminous inventions, where may be
seen again, with their peculiar appearance, the heroes
of other days, the soldiers of the Rhine and Italy, of
Austerlitz and Waterloo.</p>

<p>A truly lively period was that of 1840, a living and
unthinking generation. By the side of those great
artists of whom we have spoken, and who will be more
admired some day, there were the fantasists Travi&egrave;s
and Daumier, who adorned the illustrated journals with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
innumerable sketches, and Grandville and Gavarni, one
caricaturing animals in a celebrated book, <i>Les Animaux
Peints par Eux-m&ecirc;mes</i>, which is more than a <i>chef-d'&oelig;vre</i>;
the other coolly studying the vices and faults
of his time, with the precision of an anatomist, in
<i>Les Anglais Peints par Eux-m&ecirc;mes</i> of Labedolli&egrave;re, in
the <i>Diable &agrave; Paris</i>, without
counting a thousand
other works which his
penetrating imagination
produced.</p>

<p>Presently photography
came, which was to reverse
completely the conditions
of illustration of
the Book by the numerous
means of reproduction
to which it gave
birth. Then wood engraving
entered on a
new phase, a complete
transformation of its ordinary
terms, under the
influence of Gustave
Dor&eacute;. Little by little it had been attempted to render
in relief that which engraved plates only had hitherto
done. Black, half-tints, lowered tones, were tried where
formerly a simple line, bold and spirited, signified
everything. The house of Hachette, founded by one
of the normal teachers of the liberal movement, at the
beginning of the century, was, together with Lahure,
the promoter of relief so inclusive and practical. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
numerous periodicals of these publishers spread the
taste afar. England, for its part, entered on the road,
followed by America and Germany. To-day wood
engravings have reached perfection, finesse, and suppleness;
but they are not, properly speaking, engravings
on wood.</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that French publishers were largely
indebted to English wood engravers for their blocks.
The school that was established by Bewick and his
pupils made enormous progress. From the "Fables,"
published in 1818, we reproduce an illustration as also
a specimen from the second volume of the "British
Birds." Luke Clennell was one of the most distinguished
of Bewick's pupils; and he made some excellent
blocks, among them the illustrations to an
edition of Rogers's "Poems" (1812), engraved from
pen-and-ink drawings by Thomas Stothard. It was
Stothard's opinion that wood engraving best reproduced
pen-and-ink drawings. Other pupils of Bewick
were J. Jackson, John Thompson, who engraved
Harvey's beautiful illustrations to Milton and Henderson's
"History of Wines," S. Williams, Orrin Smith,
Robert Branston, and C. Nesbit. The most prolific
and perhaps the most popular book-illustrator of the
century in England, was George Cruikshank, who
engraved most of his own designs on wood, steel, or
with the etching needle; the catalogue of his works
by Mr. G. W. Reid, formerly keeper of the Prints in
the British Museum, occupies three quarto volumes.
The designs of "Phiz," as H. K. Browne called himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
largely contributed to the popularity of the works of
Charles Dickens; and the mere mention of Richard
Doyle and John Leech will recall the palmy days of
<i>Punch</i>, although both of these artists did excellent
work in book illustration. From the days of the Bewicks
to the present wood engraving has formed the
most widely used means of illustration in England and
the United States. Its adaptability to the printing
machine renders it admirably suited to the production
of books in large numbers and at low expense.
Without it we could not have our <i>Graphics</i> and
<i>Illustrated News</i>, nor the floods of cheap but splendidly
illustrated magazines which are appearing on both
sides of the Atlantic. True, many of these blocks are
due to the "processes" which photography has made
available, but they are nevertheless the outcome of
wood engraving. We cannot leave this subject without
mentioning the admirable "Treatise on Wood Engraving,"
by W. A. Chatto, with numerous illustrations,
published originally by H. G. Bohn in 1839 and
since reprinted.</p>

</div>

<p>In our days the great Paris publishers have returned
to the books of the eighteenth century, ornamented
with vignettes on copper; many of them purely and
simply imitate by photographic processes the pretty
editions of Eisen and Moreau, but they do not merit
the name which they bear. As to those whose
specialty is handsome books with figures by contemporary
artists, those who always are in the front,
as the Mames, Quantins, Hachettes, Plons, Jouausts,
of France; the Longmans, Murrays, Macmillans, Kegan
Pauls, Cassells, and Chattos of England; the Harpers,
Scribners, Lippincotts, and Houghtons of the United
States, they are to us what the ancients of whom we
have spoken were to their contemporaries. Now the
processes of illustration are without number: wood,
metal, heliogravure, phototype, and others. And if the
mechanical means, if the heliogravures, have at present
the importance claimed, they by no means add to the
intrinsic value of wood engravings, but to the rapidity
and economy of their manufacture. The Book, the true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Book, has nothing to do with all these inventions, and
may well confine itself to the burin or the relief block.</p>

<p>But as regards the Book, properly so called, it never
was the object of more excessive care or of more unfortunate
precipitation. It may be remarked that works
least destined to live in the libraries, those thousands
of lame pamphlets on questions of small provincial
erudition or the cap-and-sword romances, are ordinarily
the best and most carefully printed, in opposition to other
more important works composed in heads of nails and
on worn-out paper. There are in reading-rooms a
good number of pamphlets that will not be found in
fifty years, and will be worth their weight in banknotes,
even if dirty and tattered, on account of their
intrinsic value.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1">AFTER this summary, and necessarily
very compressed, sketch of
the general history of the Book,
it will not be without importance
to place some technical information
before the reader, to explain
as clearly as possible the function
of the presses, the practical side of typography, from
the engraving of the character and the founding of
types up to the binding, taking by the way composition,
impression, and collation. Many of these operations
have been already sketched in the preceding part of
our work; we have spoken of engraving of the punch,
of impression, of the thousand details that constitute
the typographic art, and the knowledge of which is so
little diffused. We return to it now, with more method,
on the different subjects, and shall try to point out the
principal features.</p>

<p>We have seen in our first chapter what patient
researches the discovery necessitated for the Mayence
printers in the founding of the character in matrix.
True, the punch and the matrix had existed from time
immemorial for coins and seals. To engrave in relief a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
punch of material hard enough to strike a resisting
metal, and to run into the space obtained by this blow
a melted alloy, which took at its extremity the same
form as the punch had given, is, in a few words, the
whole economy of the process. For the engraving of
the punches a sort of burin of tempered steel was used,
which scooped out the part intended to remain white in
the letter.</p>

<p>From the beginning the printers themselves engraved
their own characters. The most ancient, whose constant
preoccupation was the imitation of manuscript, copied
the Gothic letter of ordinary writing. Soon afterwards,
Jenson, the French refugee at Venice, designed a
round letter, like that of Sweynheim and Pannartz,
the Roman publishers, in 1467; and his type, absolutely
perfect, is used to this day.</p>

<p>In France the introducers of the invention in Paris
also imitated the Roman, but multiplied abbreviations
until they became tedious. We can imagine what the
engraving of a character could be where so few letters
stood alone, where lines abridged the nasals; the words
<i>pro</i>, <i>pre</i>, figured as in manuscripts; the sign 9 signified
<i>cum</i> or <i>con</i> in Latin or French words, without reckoning
a thousand other rigorous usages. This truly
perplexing profusion of signs as well as the want of
precision and clearness in the letter enables us now to
recognise the first Parisian <i>incunabula</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The first English printers used Gothic or black
letter. Caxton brought his first fount from Cologne,
but that which he made afterwards for himself was of
the same character. Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
their successors used the same style; and for official
publications and Bibles the black letter was used up
to the seventeenth century.</p>

century. Engraving by Jost Amman.</p>
</div>

<p>But the art of the founder-engraver was destined
to specialise itself. There were artisans in this
branch, and among them in France, in the fifteenth
century, Simon de Collines, who engraved good Roman
characters about 1480. Later was Claude Garamond,
of Paris, who died about 1561, a pupil of Geoffroy Tory,
the most celebrated of all of them; Tory definitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
proscribed the Gothic character, of which Vostre and
Verard had made constant use. Garamond worked in
this way, producing with microscopical precision new
letters, among others those of Robert Estienne, the
most marvellous and the most distinct. It was he who
was charged by Francis I. to form the celebrated royal
Greek types. He assisted in getting up the <i>Champfleury</i>
of Geoffroy Tory.</p>

<p>On his death William Leb&eacute; succeeded him, and
inherited his punches. Leb&eacute; engraved by preference
Hebrew characters, of which he made a specialty. His
travels to Rome and Venice had given him a singular
value in his art; and when he died about the end of
the century, he was incontestably the first cutter of
Oriental characters in the whole world. Philip II. of
Spain had begged him to engrave the letters of the
Bible of which Plantin had undertaken the impression,
and Francis I. had charged him to make types for the
Estiennes.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the seventeenth century we
find James Sanlecque, pupil of Leb&eacute;, and his son.
During this period several women succeeded their
husbands as type-founders. In the eighteenth century
Philip Grandjean, an artist who was royal printer to
Louis XIV., was keeper of the foundry afterwards
united, in 1725, to the Royal Printing House; Fournier
succeeded the Leb&eacute;s, then P. S. Fournier the younger,
who engraved with great success. In our days we
have seen above the Didots themselves working their
punches; and one of them, Henri, founded microscopical
characters for a La Rochefoucauld about the
middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>We have referred to English type-founders of the
eighteenth century in Chapter V.</p>

<p>The type, or character used in printing, is a composition
of lead and pure antimony, which, melted,
form a resisting and at the same time supple mixture.
Lead alone would be crushed, and the first printers
often suffered in making their experiments. The proportion
of the mixture is four of lead to one of
antimony.</p>

<p>The matrix is combined in such manner that the <i>eye</i>&mdash;that
is to say, the part of the character intended to
produce the impression&mdash;and also the shank intended
to hold the letter are cast together.</p>

<p>The letters, once founded according to their different
forms, are afterwards disposed in boxes with compartments,
or "cases." These cases serve to classify the
character by letters, italics, capitals, lower case, punctuations,
accents, etc.</p>

<p>As we have said, the relation of letters among themselves
in the composition of a language is called the
"fount." For example, it is certain that the Italian
employs the letter <i>a</i> more than <i>b</i>, the letter <i>a</i> appearing
in nearly every word; a compositor to compose in this
language should therefore have more of <i>a</i> than of <i>b</i>.
The relation between these two letters and all the
others is the "fount." In French the proportion of a
fount is about 5,000 <i>a</i> for 800 <i>b</i>, 3,000 <i>c</i>, 3,000 <i>d</i>,
11,000 <i>e</i>, etc. The fount varies with the languages. In
English the proportion is 8,500 <i>a</i> to 1,600 <i>b</i>, 3,000 <i>c</i>,
4,400 <i>d</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Before 1789 there were in all twenty different
"bodies" of letters that bore fantastic names. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
"Parisienne" was the smallest size, and the "Grosse
Nonpareille" the largest. In the sixteenth century a
character called "Civilit&eacute;" was invented. It sought
to imitate fine cursive writing. In the last century
this idea was reproduced, and the "B&acirc;tarde Coul&eacute;e,"
which did not have great success, was made. In
English types, Joseph Moxon in 1669 had eleven sizes;
Caslon in 1734 had thirty-eight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
    <a href="images/i_252f.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_252.jpg" alt="Specimen of imposition" />
  </a>
</div>


<p>When a printer wishes to compose a work, he first
decides in which body he will print it. His choice
made, he places in the compositors' "cases"&mdash;that is,
in the boxes placed before each one of his workmen&mdash;the
chosen character, with its italics, capitals, signs, etc.
Then he gives them the "copy," that is to say the
manuscript of the author to be reproduced. The compositors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
take a "galley" according to the size of the
book; and, letter by letter, by running their fingers
through the different cases, they place side by side the
words laboriously composed, and necessarily presenting
their reverse, so that they will show their proper
face when printed.</p>

<p>The composition terminated, the process of "imposition"
takes place. This is the disposition by pages
in an iron chase, in such manner that the sheet of
paper shall be printed on both sides, the pages exactly
following one another.</p>

<p>It will be seen by the specimen on the preceding
page that if the two sheets be brought together, page 2
of II. will fall exactly opposite page 1 of I, page 7
opposite page 8, and so on. Nothing is easier than
this combination for folio, quarto, or octavo sizes, but
as the smaller sizes are multiplied even to 128mo, tables
are necessary to prevent error.</p>

<p>The imposition is completed by building up the composition
in a chase by means of pieces of metal called
"furniture," which regulate the margins. When the
whole is in proper place, it is squeezed up and adjusted
by means of sunk reglets. The chase may now be
placed under the press without fear of the characters
falling out or getting mixed.</p>

<p>A pressman takes a "proof" after having rubbed
the relief of the characters with ink, and on this proof
are corrected the author's or compositor's faults by
indications in the margin by understood signs. By this
amended proof the compositor amends his faults one
by one: leaves out superfluous characters, puts turned
characters straight, spaces or draws closer the lines, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>The corrections finished, the time has come to print.
In the time of Geoffroy Tory this operation was made
as we shall explain; it was the same before and the
same after. Two pressmen have tempered with water
the tympan, or more elastic part of the carriage, against
which will be directed in good time the blow from the
type; they have also damped the paper intended for
the impression, so that it may retain the greasy ink
with which the characters are charged; then the formes
are washed before putting them under the press.</p>

<p>In the figure which we reproduce, which dates from
about 1530, we see the workshop of Jodocus Badius, of
Asch, father-in-law of two celebrated printers, Vascosan
and Robert Estienne. The press rolls&mdash;that is to say,
the formes&mdash;have been placed in the "carriage," or
movable chase, which, coming forward, receives the
sheet of paper and the ink, and returns under the
press to receive the blow of the "bar." In the room,
lighted by two windows, the compositors work. In
front one works at the bar, while his comrade distributes
the ink on the "balls." These balls are leather
pads, on which the greasy ink, made of lampblack and
oil, is spread, to more easily rub the forme after each
blow. Ordinarily the inker had two functions: he
prepared the ink, distributed it, and kept his eye on
the printed sheets to correct faults, blots, and difference
of tint. Here the workman is simply occupied by the
balls. Printed sheets and prepared paper are on a
table by the side of the press. This press is composed
of the rolling chase, the tympan, and the "frisket," a
smaller tympan, which work against one another. The
tympan, we have said above, receives directly the blow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
And it was so for nearly four centuries; the mechanical
means of our days have a little changed the work, but
the principle is always the same.</p>

Lorraine</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century, a press
cost about a hundred and twenty-seven crowns, with
its diverse utensils, as may be seen in an unpublished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
piece analysed by Dr. Giraudet, of Tours, in a very
interesting pamphlet: <i>Une Association d'Imprimeurs et
de Libraires de Paris R&eacute;fugi&eacute;s &agrave; Tours au XVI<sup>e</sup> Si&egrave;cle</i>.
The workshop of Jamet M&eacute;tayer, of Tours, cost a rent
of eighty-three crowns&mdash;about twenty pounds of current
money.</p>

<p>Workmen were then paid by the "day;" and it came
to be one of the expressions then so much used in
manual labour, corresponding to the sum of the least
work of a good workman. M. Ladev&egrave;ze, printer,
thought that the "day" represented the work of about
twenty thousand Roman or Cicero letters employed
by a compositor.</p>

<p>With us the "day" of compositors and pressmen is
differently calculated. The latter have to take a certain
number of sheets.</p>

<p>The sheet, composition and press work, cost nearly
seven crowns, or nearly two pounds. Jamet M&eacute;tayer
paid twenty crowns for four sheets in Italics; he
demanded three months for the work.</p>

<p>The primitive presses were wooden screw presses,
and they so remained until the beginning of this
century, when Lord Stanhope, a celebrated electrician,
author, and politician, perfected them and gave his
name to a new machine. His improvement consisted in
that the bar was no longer fixed to the vice, but to a
cylinder outside. A counter-weight brought back the
platen at each blow. Pierre Didot had previously made
metal platens. In 1820 the use of the Stanhope press
commenced in France.</p>

<p>England had, besides, taken a preponderating place
in typographical invention. The printer of the <i>Times</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
John Walter, at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
seeking to publish his journal quicker, associated
himself with craftsmen who constructed mechanical
presses for him. The Didots lost no time, and themselves
made improvements.</p>

<p>In 1848, the presses of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, thanks to
the application of steam, produced twenty thousand
papers an hour. In our time there are machines that
print only on one side, as well as double machines,
printing both sides at once. The rotary machines,
with endless paper, take thirty-five thousand impressions
an hour. In the newspaper machines of Marinoni,
the great inventor, the paper is unrolled, printed, cut,
and folded without leaving the machine, and falls into
a place from which it is taken ready for the subscriber.
The latest perfection of the printing press is the Walter
press and the rotary machine of R. Hoe and Co., of
New York, extensively used throughout the world.
The elaborate book has little to do with these marvellous
processes, although in its turn it largely benefits
by the improvement of the printing machine.</p>

the frame of wires. Engraving by Jost Amman.</p>
</div>

<p>It is apart from our purpose to speak at length on
the manufacture of paper. It is certain that it was well
made before the invention of printing, for most of the
accounts of the fifteenth century are written on linen
paper, very resisting and well sized. Later on rags were
used in this manufacture; and here, in a few words, is
how paper was made in the mould, or "hand-made"
before the invention of machinery for the purpose:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>The rags, having been thoroughly cleansed, were put
into vats, where they were worked up under a beating
press until they were reduced to pulp. This pulp was
thrown into hot water and stirred until the mixture
was uniformly made. Then a mould of fine wire cloth,
fixed upon a wooden frame, and having a "deckle" to
determine the size of the sheet, was taken; in the
middle of this frame was disposed, also in brass wire, a
factory mark, intended to appear in white in the sheet
of paper, and called the "water mark." This mould
was dipped into the vat of pulp and drawn out again.
After gently shaking it to and fro in a horizontal
position, the fibres of the pulp became so connected as
to form one uniform fabric; and the water escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
through the wires. The deckle was then removed
from the mould, and the sheet of paper turned off upon
a felt, in a pile with many others, a felt intervening
between each sheet, and the whole subjected to great
pressure, in order to absorb the superfluous water.
After being dried and pressed without the felts, the
sheets were dipped into a tub of size and again pressed
to remove surplus size. This primitive method of
paper-making is represented in fig. 104, and the same
principle is still in use for the production of hand-made
paper. Machinery has effected many improvements
and economies in the production
of woven paper.</p>

<p>China and Japan have their
special paper manufacture. In
Japan the material employed is
the bark of the <i>morus papifera
sativa</i>.</p>

  </a>
<p class="caption">Balance used by Jenson, at Venice.</p>
</div>


<p>According to their fineness,
size, and weight, papers have received
different names, proceeding
from the water mark.</p>

<p>Faust at Mayence used paper marked with a bull's
head. Jenson at Venice used a balance of which the
form varied. This latter came from a mill which
furnished Vicenza, Perugia, and Rome. Jenson used,
besides a crown, a cardinal's hat.</p>

<p>The bull's head underwent transformations, it had
stars and roses, and was special to Germany, and it
may sometimes be found in Italy.</p>

<p>The wires and bridges served to determine the size
of a book. Looking at a folio leaf against the light,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
the wires will be seen to be horizontal, and the bridges
vertical. In quarto they will be reversed, the paper
having been folded in four instead of in two. The
bridges become horizontal. They return to the vertical
in octavo, and so on.</p>

<p>As for ink, it was from the beginning a composition
of lampblack and oil of different quality and nature,
mixed with resin to obtain a greater and quicker dryness.
Ink for engravings was more carefully made.
For coloured inks various powders are mixed with the
oil and resin, and a title in red and black has to go
through the press twice: once for the red and once for
the black.</p>

<p>From the above it can be understood that illustrations
in relief can easily be introduced into the
composition, whether in combination with text or in
separate pages. Another question presents itself: Did
the old printers employ casting, or did they print
directly from the wood block itself? In other words,
the block having been cut, did they make with it a
mould into which melted metal could be poured to
obtain a more resistant relief? The fact is difficult to
elucidate. It appears to-day that Simon Vostre, Verard,
and others printed relief engravings on metal, but were
they cut directly or obtained by casting, as they are
now? It cannot be determined yet.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi1">LEADING the reader now towards
the final perfection of the Book:
printing, which had stirred up
and reversed so many things,
created, so to speak, the art of
binding. Previously the binder
was simply a workman sewing
together the leaves of a manuscript,
with no science or device but to clasp the whole
together solidly with cord and string. As luxury increased
the old binder was no longer thought of. On
the wooden boards which closed the Book, jewellers
encrusted their wares, lavishing ivory and precious
stones to the taste of the amateur or the bookseller.
Generally these works covered books of precious miniatures,
the <i>Hor&oelig;</i>, or manuscripts that were deemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
worthy of such magnificent clothing, rarely copies
without importance. Printing at once disordered the
tribe of copyists as well as the binders did jewellers.
The demand increasing, rich bindings were soon
abandoned, and each bookseller applied himself to the
work, or at least covered in his own house books intended
for sale. The fashion was not then to expose
for sale, as now, unbound books. Purchasers wanted
an article easy to handle, and which they were not
obliged to return for ulterior embellishment.</p>

<p>So to the public were presented the works laboriously
composed by Gutenberg, Schoeffer, and Fust, somewhat
after the manner of manuscripts, which they pretended
to imitate, with their solid wooden boards covered with
pig or calfskin. At the four corners, copper nails, with
large heads, prevented rubbing against the shelves of
the bookcase, for at that time books were ranged on
their sides, and not as they are to-day. We must
return to the bibliomaniac of the "Ship of Fools" to get
an idea of these depositories; before him may be seen
ranged on a desk large folios, with nails on their sides,
in the shelves, so defying the dust, in place of being
placed upright on their edges, which rendered them
liable to spots and stains. (See fig. 23.)</p>

<p>Unhappily the wooden sides had in themselves a
germ of destruction, the worm, capable first of reducing
the sides to powder and then ravaging the body of the
work, the ligatures and cords. Certain preparations
destroy the insect, but the precaution often has no
effect, and it is thus that the disappearance of volumes
formerly so abundant, but almost impossible to find
now, may be explained.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 105.&mdash;Bookbinder's shop in the
sixteenth century. Engraving by Jost Amman.</p>
</div>

<p>From the beginning the operations of the binder were
what they still are, except for improvements. They
consist in the collation of the sheets of a book, folding
them, beating them to bring them together and give
them cohesion, and sewing them, first together, then on
the cords or strings, which form the five or six bands
seen on the backs. Primitively these cords were united
to the wooden boards, and over both was placed a resistant
skin, on which from relief or metal engravings
were struck the most pleasing decorative subjects.
Pigskin, white and fine, lent itself, especially among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the Germans, to these fine editions; and although they
were issued in great number, the wooden boards have
not permitted them all to exist in our time.</p>

<p>The most ancient that we are able to cite are German
works of the time of Louis XI.; they are very strong
and coarse. The cords in them form an enormous and
massive projection. The inside of the board was often
without lining of paper or stuff. In the case of fine
editions a sombre velvet was sometimes used, such
as Verard used to bind the books of the father of
Francis I., as we have before said.</p>

<p>Art did not enter into these works of preservation
until about the end of the fifteenth century, with
arms and emblems. At the beginning of the sixteenth
century, some bindings were ornamented for Louis XII.
and the Queen, Anne de Bretagne; but not more than
five or six specimens remain. They are of coarse aspect.
The workman who tooled the binding here reproduced
from the curious example of M. Dutuit, of Rouen, has
thrown his subjects one upon another. Arms, porcupines,
ermines, are treated so as to be confusing, and
form a medley that is not pleasing. In recalling the
delightful borders of Vostre and Pigouchet, contemporaries
of this mediocre work, it is astonishing to see
the degree of inferiority reached by a profession that
should be inspired by graceful subjects of decoration.</p>

</div>

<p>It happened that France again found in Italy masters
capable of revealing secrets of composition and arrangement
to enable her to strike out a new road. The Italian
wars would not have had these artistic results if it had
not been for the enormous sums that they swallowed
up. The curious part of the enterprise was that a
war treasurer, a financier, employed by the French
kings in these expeditions, through his relations of
taste and friendship with the Alduses of Venice, brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
to France the love of sumptuous bindings, of editions
superbly clothed. He was named Jean Grolier, that
bibliophile of the sixteenth century, who was, above all
others, even King Francis, the first to appreciate the art
of binding. It is not too much to say art, for if better
had not been done before, it may safely be said that
nothing better has been done since; and the books of
Grolier remain as the most perfect and most admirable
types of this kind of decoration.</p>

<p>Born of an Italian family established at Lyons, where
most of his relatives did a great business, Jean Grolier
had the good fortune to succeed his father, Stephen
Grolier, treasurer of the Duke of Milan. He became
in his turn Minister of Finances, and was called to accompany
the kings in their expeditions in Italy. The
situation of the treasurers during these campaigns was
important; they handled the pence levied with great
trouble in the cities of France "for making war." Many
abused their trust, and were punished, and among others
the Lallemants, whom documents show us to have
been in connection with Grolier, and who suffered, with
Semblan&ccedil;ay, the most terrible trials of the time.</p>

<p>Italian art gave then a free course in the decoration
of books. Of the interior we have spoken in our first
chapters on the wood engravings; for the exterior, the
cover of the volume, foliage, golden flowers worked
with a hot iron, and polychromatic compartments obtained
by coloured pastes were multiplied. Thus was
produced on the outside that which it was not sought
to obtain on the inside, the variation of tints so select
among the Italians, and so forsaken since the invention
of printing. In the midst of these literary men was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
lover of books and fine connoisseur who, not content
with choosing the best editions, such as those of
Ferrara, Venice, and Basle, bound them superbly, with
compartments of admirable tone, and had his name and
device inscribed on the sides in the fashion of the
time. He was named Thomas Maioli, and following
the custom of the amateurs of the time, he offered
the enjoyment of his library to his friends. "Tho.
Maioli et amicorum," he inscribed, as did later Grolier,
as also did others, but he somewhat modified the enthusiasm
of his friendship by a sceptical device, "Ingratis
servire nephas," which might very well be
the cry of the owner of books betrayed by his
borrowers.</p>

<p>Maioli did not alone use these devices; he had also
a macaronic phrase of which the sense is not very
clear: "Inimici mei mea michi, non me michi." He
also sometimes used his monogram, which was composed
of all the letters of his name.</p>

<p>The relations of Grolier with this unknown and
mysterious bibliophile, whose name is not always
found outside his volumes, are not doubtful. Brunet
possessed a volume that had belonged to Maioli and
had passed through the hands of Grolier. What better
proof could be wished of the communion of ideas and
tastes between the two collectors?</p>

<p>But these amateurs were not alone. Beside them
were princes and great lords, lay and ecclesiastic.
From the commencement of the sixteenth century
bookbinding had received an enormous impulse from
the tastes and the predilections for these lofty fancies.
And it cannot be ascribed to the simple skill of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
workmen experimenting in that line. In the century
that saw Italian artists occupied in making designs for
mounted plates and painting beautiful ladies, the courtesans
of Venice could not be alarmed at finding them
painting models for bindings, with compartments of
varied tone and style. Maioli affected white on a
dark background, that is to say on a background of
dark leather. He made scrolls of foliage in white or
clear paste with a very happy effect.</p>

<p>This was the time when Grolier travelled in Italy,
in the suite of the French, and when he began his
collections. He had adopted as his heraldic emblem
the gooseberry bush, which in French came very near
to his name&mdash;<i>groseillier</i>; and his motto was "Nec
herba nec arbor" ("Neither tree nor herb"), explicative
of the moderation of his wealth. He was soon in connection
with the Alduses, and through them with the
principal learned men and binders of the time, for it
was not in the offices of the Manutiuses that could be
found workmen, like those of the Chamber of Accounts
in France, obliged to swear that they did not know how
to read. The master was not hindered by details of
difference of language, and it followed that his workmen
understood Greek and Latin, for he often gave them
instruction in those languages. How far off these
erudite and conscientious workmen appear to-day!</p>

<p>Following the fashion, Grolier put his name on the
upper side of his books&mdash;"Jo. Grolierii et amicorum"&mdash;in
gold letters, and on the other side a pious motto,
the sense of which was a hope often uttered by the
financiers of the sixteenth century, imprisoned and
hung every instant: "Portio mea, Domine, sit in terra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
viventium." Generally all the Grolier books which
came from the Alduses have the name on the upper
side and the motto on the other side; the title was
placed above the name, and often disposed in rows.
Some large volumes had the cover ornamented with an
architectural design, like the Jamblichus of the Libri collection,
which had on the front the fa&ccedil;ade of a temple,
with the title in rows on the door. This volume was
printed by Aldus in 1516, and probably decorated by
him for the account of the great French amateur.</p>

<p>Jean Grolier is said to have himself designed some
of the subjects of his ornaments, and their perfection indicates
an active and enlightened supervision. On his
return to France, where he had a house near the Porte
de Bucy, he was put in relation with Geoffroy Tory,
the artist best fitted to understand him, and who was
at once painter, engraver, printer, and binder. It was
there that, in the leisure of his financial functions, between
two projects of revictualling the forts of Outre
Seine and Yonne, Grolier invented combinations, sought
interlacings, and laid out foliage. Tory himself teaches
us these works in combination. He invented antique
letters for Grolier, he tells us in his <i>Champfleury</i>. It
was for him, too, that he interwove so finely his
compartments for binding, and that he reproduced the
delightful ornaments of his books of hours in golden
scrolls.</p>

<p>As we have said, Grolier placed his titles on the
sides of his books on account of the arrangement of the
works on the shelves of the library where they were
laid. For this reason also the back was neglected, and
no ornament used upon it; thick and heavy with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
projecting bands, without decoration between the bands,
this part of the bound volume was a kind of waste in
a splendidly cultivated garden. The profusion of books
brought about a revolution. There was no longer room
to place on their sides the innumerable books that
were produced; they were then placed on their edges,
as now, and the back also was decorated. For this
the bands were made to disappear, and replaced by
decorative subjects in compartments like the sides.
Then with Grolier the bands reappeared, and the
title was placed between them, as it still is.</p>

<p>The books of Grolier have been divided, according
to their production, in four or five principal classes, in
which they may always be placed. First were the
works ornamented in compartments, gilt, with scrolls
in full gold; then the same with the scrolls <i>azur&eacute;s</i>, that
is to say equally gilt, but having parallel lines like the
<i>azure</i> of heraldry. Following comes the school of
Geoffroy Tory, with gilt compartments in the style of
the great French decorator; last the polychromatic
bindings, in which, by the aid of colour or mastic, the
alternating tones are mixed. Grolier also had some
mosaic bindings, composed of little pieces of leather
connected by incrustation or paste, pure Italian bindings;
but these were not numerous, especially if compared
with those conceived in the manner of Geoffroy
Tory.</p>

<p>One of these latter works is here reproduced from
one of the beautiful books in the collection of M. Dutuit.
This copy has the back flat, and the interlacings of the
decoration are most complicated and clever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Grolier got his Levant moroccos through the dealers of

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Born in 1479, the Treasurer-general of Outre Seine
lived until 1565. In 1563 an original manuscript shows
him much occupied with finance at over eighty-four years
of age; but his passion for bindings had cooled down, for
few books signed with his name are found the manufacture
of which could descend to the son of Henri II.
After great trials, after having seen Semblan&ccedil;ay suffer
at Montfaucon, John Lallemand beheaded, and himself
having come nearly to losing life and fortune at one
blow, Grolier passed away quietly in his house, having
collected most of the fine books of the time and many
curious medals. Christopher de Thou, his friend and
<i>confr&egrave;re</i> in the love of books, had saved his reputation
before the Parliament of Paris. After his death his
library was transported to the Hotel de Vic, and from
there dispersed in 1675, a hundred years after.</p>

<p>Thus from Italian art came French binding, still remaining
original. The kings did not fail to follow the
movement, and even to anticipate it, thanks to the means
at their disposal. We have seen Francis I. at work
with the energy of an artisan at least; but Geoffroy Tory
was his principal inspirer, and who knows but that he
was the chief operative for the prince, as for the great
financier?</p>

<p>We have said that Louis XII. knew nothing of fine
bindings. During his travels in Italy he had received
presentation copies of magnificently covered books, and
among others that of <i>Faustus Andrelinus</i>, that was
bound in calf in honour of the King. He, who was so
little expert in fine arts, purchased the entire library of
the Sire de la Gruthuse, and substituted his own emblems
for those of the high and mighty lord. Francis I., with
innate sentiment for masterpieces and the powerful
protection he had given them, did not allow the experiments
of Grolier to pass unnoticed. The King did
not desire to be behind the treasurer, and the workmen
were put to the task. He adopted the salamander,
which emblem he used on his castles and furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
and the liveries of his people; he lavished it also on the
sides of his books. On the side the "F" is often seen
crowned, then the emblem of France and the collar of
St. Michael. In the binding of which a facsimile is
here given, Geoffroy Tory has singularly inspired the
gilder, if he did not himself make the design. For it
must not be thought that this work is done at a single
blow by means of an engraved plate or a block. On
the contrary, every line is impressed by the hot tool
that the workman applies by hand to the gold laid on
in advance, making it, so to speak, enter into the skin
or morocco. There is the art; blocks serve only for
commercial bindings, quickly impressed and intended
for ordinary purchasers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>Under the reign of Francis I. the binders were the
booksellers, as Verard and Vostre were. The King was
ordinarily served by a publisher named Pierre Roffet,
and he frequently figures in accounts that have been
preserved. Roffet not only bound, but it appears that
he rebound books to patterns which the King desired.
Philip Lenoir and Guyot Marchant were also royal
workmen. The latter, whose mark is here reproduced,
frequently added to it the saints Crispin and Crispinian,
patrons of the leather-dressers, who prepared the leather
for the binder.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>The discoveries of Grolier did not allow the binders
much time to be idle. Thousands of volumes were
then destroyed to make the boards for sides. From
this many discoveries are made in our days by pulling
to pieces sixteenth century work, unknown playing
cards, and early printed works. To mention only one
example, twenty leaves of the "Perspective" of Viator
were discovered in the National Library of Paris. The
board thus formed was covered indifferently with sheepskin,
parchment, calf, morocco, or goatskin; the books
were sewn on raised or sunk bands, according to the
owner's taste; the edges were gilt, sometimes gauffered,
and designs often impressed upon them to match those
of the sides. In large folios wooden boards were still
used, more solid, and protected from rubbing by nails
in relief. But the inside of the cover was as yet
only covered with paper. Leather linings were very
uncommon.</p>

<p>The reign of Henri II. increased yet more the importance
of bindings; it was the time when Grolier collected,
and clever artists came from all parts. Geoffroy Tory
had given the best models for letters and interlacings.
The Queen, Catherine, derived from her parents the taste
for decoration in gold and colours, and patronised the
artists called by her from the court of Florence; and
the favourite, Diane de Poitiers, Duchess of Valentinois,
rivalled her in luxury and expenditure. Henri II. in
the decoration of his castles, as well as his books, introduced
equivocal emblems, of which the signification
may be doubtful, but those of his mistress may be
recognised, not those of the legitimate Queen. He interlaced
two reversed "D's" by an "H," in the form shown
in the border on the preceding page. Strictly speaking,
we ought to see there two "C's" back to back; but as
we find the "D" on all the bindings displaying the
arms of Diana, there can be no doubt, and Queen
Catherine doubted less than anybody. Other emblems
of Diana are to be found in the arcs and crescents that
are plentifully displayed. The library of Diana was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
large, owing to the King not hesitating to take valuable
books from the public collections for her. Two centuries
after her death it was dispersed, and the greater part of
the books belonging to the national collections were restored
on the deaths of those who then purchased them.
Hence the largest number of the bindings of Henri II.
and Diana of Poitiers will be found in the National
Library of Paris.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>Queen Catherine also had special patterns with a
monogram identical with the double "D" mentioned
above, but the branches of the "C" were a little longer
than the branches of the "H;" she also used a "K"
on the sides of her books. The specimen which we
reproduce is a purely Italian work.</p>

<p>From kings and queens the fashion passed to the
great lords, it having come to the kings and queens from
a private individual. The Constable Anne de Montmorency
adorned his bindings with a cross and spread eagle.
Among the amateurs of binding of the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and eighteenth centuries using distinctive marks,
we may mention Philip Desportes, the poet, who used
two &#934; enlaced, as did also Superintendent Fouquet
in the seventeenth century. The brothers Dupuy
adopted the double &#916;, arranged as a star. Colbert
had a curled snake (<i>coluber</i> for Colbert!), the Gondis
two masses of arms, Madame de Pompadour three
towers, etc. Fouquet beside the &#934; used a squirrel
on some of his bindings.</p>

<p>In Germany, Count Mansfeldt adopted the ornamental
style with arms, of which a specimen is here
given; and Marc Laurin de Watervliet also decorated
and dedicated his books to his friends, using the motto
"Virtus in arduo." Among the lords of the French
courts who favoured polychromatic ornament and bold
compositions were the young Valois, Louis de Sainte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Maure, Marquis of Nesle, and Henri de Guise, called
"Le balafr&eacute;."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>Charles IX. had his emblems and devices, the double
"C" crowned the legend "Pietate et justitia," but his
brother, Henri III., loved the decoration of books more
than he did. The passion of the King for miniatures
which he cut out of books is known; this passion for
golden things he repeated on bindings, for which he
chose special designs. Henri III. was an amateur of
dances of death; he visited cemeteries, attended funerals,
and took a death's-head for his emblem. This emblem
was not his invention; long before him Marot had
addressed an epigram to a lady in which he brought
love and death into close conjunction. However that
may be, the King chose skeletons and penitents' tears
to ornament his books. He also tolerated diamonds,
although he absolutely prohibited them in the clothing
of ladies or fixed the number <i>pro rata</i> with the rank of
the authorised person. There was in this prince a singular
mixture of taste and artistic acuteness by the side
of a mania or hallucination which was reflected on the
most intimate objects of his apparel or of his furniture.
Thus if we find, at the end of the sixteenth century,
a death's-head on the sides or the back of a volume,
the binding is of the period of Henri III.</p>

fanfare</i>. In the Dutuit collection.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>The binders of his time are known by the mention
that is made of them in the royal accounts; the Eves
were the most celebrated among all of them. Nicholas
Eve was charged with the binding of the Statutes of
the Order of St. Esprit, with which the King gratified
his friends. Mention of this work is found in the Clairambault
manuscripts, where we read, "To Nicholas Eve,
washer and binder of books and bookseller to the King,
forty-seven and a half escus for washing, gilding, and
squaring the edges of forty-two books of statutes
and ordinances of the Order, bound and covered with
orange Levant morocco, enriched on one side with the
arms of the King, fully gilt, and on the other of France
and Poland, with monograms at the four corners, and
the rest flames, with orange and blue ribbons," etc.</p>

<p>Louise de Lorraine, wife of Henri III., counted for
little in the life of her husband; nevertheless she had
a certain number of books decorated with their united
escutcheons.</p>

<p>The bindings attributed to Eve were decorated all
over the sides and back with interlacing patterns of
geometrical character, the spaces between the parallel
lines and in the middle of the figures left at first quite
blank, but afterwards filled in with palm branches and
wreaths of foliage; to these delicate and elaborate yet
brilliant toolings have been given the name of bindings
<i>&agrave; la fanfare</i>. This designation requires explanation,
and is a good example of the grotesque style adopted
by modern amateurs in their appellations.</p>

<p>The fine work of that time prepared for the coming
in the seventeenth century&mdash;about 1620&mdash;of the works
of Le Gascon, or at least for the artist with whom
in our days are connected the works of the reign of
Louis XIII. Under Henri IV. the fleur-de-lys occupied
most of the covers of the royal books, from vellum
to Levant morocco; works in this class had nothing very
remarkable. The first years of Louis XIII. revealed
a new process, inspired by the Eves. Le Gascon
embroidered delightfully on the fanfare ornaments;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
showing the fibres of the leaves, he made a new kind of
ornament, consisting of minute gold dots elaborated into
lines and curves of singular brilliancy and elegance.
Of this style, called <i>pointill&eacute;</i>, we give a specimen from
the collection of M. Dutuit. The fashion had arrived
all at once; lace, banished from clothing by severe
edicts, found a refuge on the covering of books.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 115.&mdash;Le Gascon binding.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>The times were hard then for binders; they were
constrained to live in the university and to employ
only its workmen. A binder was never his own gilder;
he employed the <i>gaufreurs</i> of shoe-leather, more expert
and bolder, to gild his leather. Among these artisans
was one named Pigorreau, whom the edict found living
in the midst of publishers and working for them; he
was compelled to choose either to remain bootmaker
or become bookseller; he chose the latter, against the
syndics of the trade, against every one, and he made
enemies for himself. He revenged himself by turning
the masters into ridicule in a placard.</p>

<p>Le Gascon was probably the assumed name of an
artist in this style. The <i>Guirlande de Julie</i>, worked
by him for Mademoiselle de Rambouillet, gave him
great honour in the special circle of this little literary
court. It was the fashion then for poor authors
to put a fine covering on their works and to offer
them to the great for their own profit. Tallement des
Reaux notably signalises the poet Laserre, who displayed
his luxury in irreproachable bindings. And
then the farmers of the revenue, successors of Grolier
in financial trusts, formed libraries for pure fashion,
never opening the volumes covered for them in sumptuous
attire. If we may believe Sauval, author of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
<i>Antiquit&eacute;s de Paris</i>, they went further, and on covers
without books inscribed imaginary titles and fantastic
squibs to mislead their visitors. The bookcase being
carefully closed, it was difficult to discover the imposition.
Sauval writes, "In place of books, they are
content with covers of Levant morocco, on the backs of
which, in gold letters, are inscribed the names of the
most celebrated authors. A binder of the university
assured me that not long since he and his <i>confr&egrave;res</i>
had made them for a single financier to the amount
of 10,000 crowns!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<p class="caption">Fig. 116.&mdash;Le Gascon binding for Cardinal Mazarin.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>The works of Le Gascon will be found more among
great personages than with the so-called collectors,
which gives value to their grace and charm. The
King's brother Gaston possessed them, then Mazarin,
an example from whose library is here reproduced.
On this binding Le Gascon worked gilt compartments
and elaborate arabesques; in the middle of the sides are
the arms of the Cardinal and his pretentious device:
"Arma Julii ornant Franciam!"&mdash;"The arms of Jules
the ornament of France!" In spite of the profusion of
subjects, nothing could better please the eye or indicate
a man of taste.</p>

<p>But if Le Gascon be a legendary personage, he had
an imitator or rival, very near to him, named Florimond
Badier, whose works had at least the advantage
of being signed. At the bottom of the inside cover of
an inlaid morocco binding in the National Library at
Paris is the inscription "Florimond Badier fec., inv."
The analogy between this work and those known as
Le Gascon's is palpable; inside and outside, the cover
is stippled with small tools (<i>au petit fer</i>) in the same
manner. Florimond Badier was not appointed bookseller
until 1645, and so could not have composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
earlier bindings attributed to Le Gascon, but this
resemblance of style evidences the existence of a
Parisian school, the adepts of which copied one another,
as they do nowadays.</p>

<p>The work was soon simplified; pallets and wheel-shaped
tools were invented to produce that which was
improperly called <i>dentelle</i>; this mechanical work was
done by a wheel-shaped tool, previously heated, on gold
in sized leaves, on which it impressed its projections.</p>

<p>With Louis XIV. the passion for gilding increased.
Charming festoons were designed, but they were soon
abused, and inundated the libraries. On the sides
were seen rising suns, arms, and golden garlands.
Cramoisy directed the royal bindings, the King having
devoted large sums to the purchase of Levant leathers.
In 1666 the Director of Works ordered red moroccos;
in 1667 he received twenty-two dozen skins, amounting,
with the expenses of transport, to 1,020 livres tournois.
Successive supplies were made, and were used for the
royal library, sixty-nine dozen in 1667, forty-six dozen
in 1668, and three hundred and thirty-three dozen in
1670, costing the King more than 12,000 livres. On
these admirably dressed skins, which, in spite of incessant
use, still remain now as in their first days, the
King caused to be applied, according to the size,
tools of borders, having in the middle the arms of
France, with the collar of St. Esprit.</p>

<p>Among the binders mentioned in the very useful work
of M. J. J. Guiffrey on the expenditure of Louis XIV.,
we find Gilles Dubois, who died before 1670; Levasseur,
binder of Huet, Bishop of Avranches; La Tour,
M&eacute;rins or M&eacute;rius, who died before 1676; and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
Ruette, the reputed inventor of marbled paper for fly-leaves
of books: to him the bindings of the Chancellor
de S&eacute;guier, with their ornament of the golden fleece, and
of Madame de S&eacute;guier, are attributed. It was probably
these men who decorated the books of the brothers
Dupuy, Fouquet, and Colbert, marvellous works of
solidity, if not always of elegance, which have resisted
all assaults. Unhappily, in many instances the mechanical
<i>dentelle</i> overburdened the work, and gave it a
commonplace regularity. In the Cond&eacute;, Colbert, and
perhaps even Madame de Longueville's collections,
there are many specimens of this kind with two or
three filleted borders.</p>

<p>We have come to an epoch when the difficulties
resulting from confusion between the booksellers' and
binders' trades began to be understood. The revocation
of the Edict of Nantes had implicitly prepared
a crowd of measures and rules in all branches of
national industry. It was a good occasion to prevent
the artisans of binding unduly parading themselves as
booksellers and selling merchandise of which they
understood nothing; Louis XIV. interfered, and separated
the two communities. The binders then became
the <i>relieurs-doreurs</i> of books; they had their own
organisation, but remained subject to the university;
the heads of the fraternity were called the "guards."
The principal arrangements of the regulation of 1749
were: the members of the corporation had the sole
right to bind books, from the elegant volume to registers
of blank paper. Five years of apprenticeship and three
of companionship were necessary to obtain the brevet
of freedom and to hold a shop. Moreover, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
indispensable to read and write. One regulation ordained
that the workman should be "able to bind and
ornament ordinary books or others, to render them
perfect and entire, to sew the sheets at most two together
with thread and real bands, with joints of
parchment, and not paper, and in case of infraction
the said books were to be remade at the expense of
the offender, who was besides condemned to a penalty
of thirty livres for each volume." Their establishment
was confined to the quarter from the Rue St. Andr&eacute; des
Arts to the Place Maubert; they regulated the sale of
calfskin and of tools; in a word, they were surrounded
by precautions by which the production remained
always under the supervision of the masters and completely
satisfied the client. This calculating policy
was, in fact, a close imitation of the royal ordinance of
1686.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 117.&mdash;Mosaic binding of the eighteenth century for
the <i>Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The mosaic bindings used from the end of the reign
of Louis XIV. were an application of pared leathers
of colours different from the background, pasted on to
the side. The binders of the regency composed a
great number, attributed now to Pasdeloup, as all the
crayons of the sixteenth century are called Clouets,
and all the panels on wood Holbeins. It is not that
there was great originality in these works, or a particular
art; more often the workman did no more than
transcribe Le Gascon or Eve or the older binders, and
accommodated the processes of these artists to the
fashion of his time. In this style we may cite the
<i>Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante</i>, printed at Paris 1584,
for which the binder designed a cover of doubtful taste
and, above all, an undeniable want of proportion. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
tendency was then to flowers occupying three-fourths
of the page, to compartments too large, to open pomegranates,
like the <i>Spaccio</i> here reproduced. If Pasdeloup
had discovered these mediocre combinations, he
could not be proclaimed the regenerator of a fallen art.
The bastard style of these works may be compared to
their mosaics, constructed of pieces; it is a little of
everything, and together it is nothing. However, in
the midst of the quantity of mediocre things, some
pleasing decoration is from time to time met with;
the design of a volume with the arms of the Regent
and his wife, Mademoiselle de Blois, wants neither
elegance nor taste; without being perfection, it has
better proportion and balance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>

<p class="caption">Fig. 118.&mdash;Mosaic binding of the eighteenth century, with
the arms of the Regent. M. Morgand's collection.</p>
</div>

<p>We should, however, hesitate to give names to all these
works. Besides Pasdeloup, there were the Deromes,
abandoning a little the mosaics, devising flowers and
<i>dentelles</i> in combination, and no longer the simple
products of the fillet. They formed a dynasty; and if
the Pasdeloups were at least twelve, there were fourteen
Deromes all booksellers and binders from the
reign of Louis XIV. The most celebrated was James
Anthony, who died in 1761.</p>

<p>Peter Paul Dubuisson was not only a binder; he
was a designer. He invented heraldic ornaments, and
composed models of gilding tools, in which his contemporaries
emulated him. He was intimate with the
delicate vignettist Eisen, and the counsels of an artist
of this value could not but be useful to him. It is an
extraordinary thing that in this world of celebrated
printers, amateur financiers, and notable painters and
engravers, not a single man can be met to give a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
impulse to the art of which we speak, and to prevent
the dull continuance of experiments on the whole so
poor. Doubtless the <i>dentelles</i> of Derome had a certain
air of gaiety, to which the books of the eighteenth century
accommodated themselves perfectly; the tools of
Dubuisson produce most pleasing designs; but the old,
the great binders, had altogether disappeared.</p>

<p>Besides, Derome massacred without pity the rarest
works. He loved edges very regularly cut, and he did
not fail to hew down margins opposed to his taste.
He sawed books as well; that is to say, in place of
sewing the sheets on to projecting bands, he made a
groove in the back, in which the cord was embedded.
The books have no resistance.</p>

<p>To these celebrated names of French binders of the
eighteenth century we may add Le Monnier, who
worked for the Orleans princes; Tessier, his successor;
Lafert&eacute;, who decorated the small volumes of the Duc de
la Valli&egrave;re as Chamot covered the large ones; in 1766
Chamot was royal binder. There was also Pierre
Engerrand, then Biziaux, an original, who worked for
Madame de Pompadour and Beaumarchais. Boyet, or
Boyer, worked (1670-80) in the style of Le Gascon,
with the same minute tooling, but simpler in character.
Duseuil put very elaborate and delicate tooling on his
covers from about 1710 to 1720.</p>

<p>The Revolution effaced many of the fine works
which displayed the symbols "of a royalty justly
detested," and Mercier wrote certain wicked little
poems against binding. Lesn&eacute; was the poet of bookbinding,
and he invented the process of plain calf
without boards. Certainly from Grolier to Lesn&eacute; there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
were numerous changes, so numerous that, in spite of
the nude calf, it may be said that the art was nearly
dead. In our days it has a little recovered. Amateurs
have found new names, and often artists, to patronise:
Trautz-Bauzonnet, Cap&eacute;, Duru, Lortic, Marius Michel,
in France; Bedford, Rivi&egrave;re, Zaehnsdorf, Pratt, in
England; Matthews, Bradstreet, Smith, in the United
States; and many others. Unhappily, fortune does
not permit every one to furnish his library luxuriously;
the true connoisseur searches rather for Groliers, Eves,
and Le Gascons, than concerns himself about modern
workmanship. Whatever may be its value, it is only
fit to clothe the works of the time. A book published
by Lemerre and bound by Petit is in true character, but
a fifteenth or sixteenth century book passed under the
hands of Trautz-Bauzonnet himself will be very much
like an ancient enamel in a modern frame newly gilt.</p>

<p>Bookbinding in England has, with very few exceptions,
never attained the artistic excellence reached
in France. From the earliest times to the present day
servile imitations of foreign work only are seen. The
one purely original English binder is Roger Payne,
who from about 1770 worked for thirty or forty years
in London, performing with his own hands every stage
of the work, even to cutting his own tools. The result
was good, solid work, with perfectly original and often
very beautiful decoration, appropriate to the character
of the work itself. His favourite style was drooping
lines of leaf ornaments in the borders and geometrical
patterns in small tools. After him came Charles Lewis,
who was an artist in the true sense of the word, and,
coming down to our own time, Francis Bedford, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
never pretending to originality, copied the best designs
of the old French and Italian binders. His full calf
books, with handsomely tooled backs, are models of
solidity and taste; and his decorations on the sides of
morocco-bound books are always in good taste, and
often of great elegance. The binders of the present
day, perhaps for lack of patronage, seem to have
abandoned originality; and although much excellent
work is done, it is no more than a copy of the Eves,
Le Gascon, Derome, and the older artists.</p>

<p>Parallel with the luxurious bindings with which we
have been exclusively occupied, there has always been
the commercial work, prepared in advance. Liturgical
works, above all, are sold in this form. Books in
the Grolier style or other grand personages were
worked from a pattern engraved in relief, leaving
nothing to the caprice of the artist, by being applied
to the side by a press. This process is termed blocking.
Germany made use of this process principally;
also Vostre, Verard, and Tory employed the same
means. Even the interlacings and the capricious
arabesques of Grolier were imitated by means of a
fixed plate, parts of which were finished by hand
to make it appear a complete work of imagination
and handicraft.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi1">ART, science, and literature took
refuge in convents before the invention
of Printing, and libraries
did not count many books. According
to daily wants, the monastery
scribes copied the treatises lent
by neighbouring houses, and the collection was thus
painfully made during many centuries. Two or three
hundred works constituted ordinary collections; the
powerful abbeys found in their staff the means of
enriching their libraries, as we have said, but they
were the privileged ones.</p>

<p>Excepting kings and some princes, few people possessed
a library. The great expense of transcription,
the want of facility for procuring originals, and the
enormous price of manuscripts left no hope to bibliophiles
of moderate fortune. Typography, on the contrary,
having multiplied books and put at relatively
modest prices reproductions formerly inaccessible,
private collections commenced. We have had occasion
to speak before of Grolier and Maioli; they were the
most illustrious, but not the only ones.</p>

<p>At first a public library was an unknown thing.
The richest and the most easily got together, that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
the King of France, was private. Since John the Good
in France the acquisitions were numerous, and Gutenberg's
invention contributed to augment the stock of
volumes everywhere. Charles VIII. and Louis XII.
found or took in their expeditions in Italy, and were
able to add to the original nucleus, many rare editions,
especially from the Sforzas at Pavia, who had marvels
without number. Brought together at Blois, under
the care of John de Labarre, the royal library did not
yet occupy a very large space, in spite of its increase.
Under Charles V. the number of books was about a
thousand; about 1500 or 1510 they were nearly
doubled, and the printed books did not number more
than two hundred.</p>

<p>So restricted, the royal library travelled with the
other treasures of the Crown; Francis I. transported
it from Blois to Fontainebleau, and even parts of it to
the Italian wars, as related above. In its new quarters
the royal collection, in spite of the successive accessions
of the books of John d'Angoul&ecirc;me, grandfather of the
King, and of those of the dukes of Orleans, counted
but 1,781 manuscripts and a hundred and nine printed
books on the shelves. The King, ambitious in literature
no less than in arts, nominated an illustrious
<i>savant</i>, Guillaume Bud&eacute;, to the office of master of his
library; and this qualification was maintained by his
successors until the fall of the royal power.</p>

<p>With Bud&eacute; commenced the system of continuous
acquisitions. The treasury was liberally opened to
vendors of rarities. At this time the books, placed
upon their sides, one upon another, gave no idea of
a modern library, with its volumes ranged on end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
having their titles between the bands of the back. In
speaking of Grolier, we remarked that the sides of a
binding alone had importance on account of their place
on the shelves; it was the same with Francis I.</p>

<p>Under Henri II. the Fontainebleau collection was
somewhat pillaged for Diana of Poitiers, but, as a corrective
for this dilapidation, the King adopted a measure,
since preserved, which substituted for acquisitions
a regular and uninterrupted supply; this was the contribution
by publishers to the library of one bound
copy on vellum of all the works printed under privilege.
The ordinance was made in 1556; the successors of
Henri II. had only this means of increasing the
number of their volumes, with the exception that
Charles IX. expended a large sum in the purchase of
Grolier's collection of medals.</p>

<p>Such was the working of the royal library for about
a half-century, but the idea of making it public had not
come. Diffused as was then the passion for books, it
had not yet been democratised to the point of being
understood by the people. Amateurs and lovers of
reading formed special collections in their houses, at
times rivalling that of the King. Then the fashion was
no more to lay the books on their sides, but they were
now ranged to allow room for new acquisitions.
Henri IV., who had not his great-uncle's predilection
for Fontainebleau, commanded the removal to Paris of
the books buried in the castle. He added to them
those of Catherine de Medicis coming from Marshal
Strozzi; and as the college of Clermont had become
vacant by the dispersion of the Jesuits, he lodged the
library in 1599 in one of the rooms of that establishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
under the care of James Augustus de Thou,
master of the library.</p>

<p>We now see the royal collection brought to Paris,
which it has never quitted; but before its definitive
installation, before it was made public, it passed through
a century, during which additions were made, purchases
increased, and the number of manuscripts and
printed books augmented in enormous proportions.
Henri IV. desired to place it near the court, to avoid
pillage and to have the chief librarian near to him.
The return of the Jesuits in 1604 upset the first
establishment a little; the college of Clermont was
evacuated; the books were transported to the Cordeliers
and distributed in rooms on the ground and first floors,
whence the names of upper and lower libraries. There
was a mass of volumes very little used, for the public
did not enjoy them, and the King held them as his
own; but the time was near when the collection was
to take a very serious step under the influence of the
brothers Dupuy in 1645, and afterwards of Jerome
Bignon. Always shut up in the incommodious
chambers of the Cordeliers, the library contained
5,259 volumes, manuscript and printed, perhaps less
than some private libraries; after the Dupuys it had
at least 10,329 printed books.</p>

<p>Mazarin was the first to comprehend the natural use
of collections of books: publicity. His private library,
placed before 1651 in his magnificent house in the
Rue Richelieu, where later was definitively lodged
the royal library, was opened to readers every
Tuesday, from eight to eleven and two to five. Dispersed
in 1651, at the fall of the Cardinal, it was later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
reconstituted, and in less than ten years afterwards the
former minister was able to open it in its new quarters,
the College of the Four Nations, where it is still.</p>

<p>While the Mazarin library was administering liberally
to the wants of the public, that of the King remained
closely shut up in the rooms of the Cordeliers. Colbert,
influenced by this state of things, offered two houses
in the Rue Vivienne to the King, where the books could
find a more convenient lodging, and allow room for
increase. The removal was made in 1666. The royal
collection for fifty-five years was lodged only a few
steps from its final resting-place, the Hotel de Nevers.
So was called at the end of the seventeenth century
the splendid mansion of Mazarin, situated near the
Porte de Richelieu, in the street of the same name,
whence his books had been previously torn and sold
to all the dealers. Divided into two parts at the death
of the Cardinal in 1661, the palace fell, one part to the
Duc de Mazarin, the other to the Duc de Nevers, his
nephews. At first the King dreamed, under the advice
of Louvais, of acquiring the land in the neighbourhood
of the Rue Vivienne and of elevating a monument
for his library, for the thought of putting the Hotel de
Nevers to this use had not then occurred to him; but
the Duc de Mazarin having alienated his part of the
palace in favour of the Company of the Indies, Abb&eacute;
Bignon, then royal librarian, perceived the part he
could play from that fact.</p>

<p>Thanks to the administration of Colbert and the
liberalities of the King, the collection had been augmented
threefold. At the time of the removal to the
Rue Vivienne, Nicolas Cl&eacute;ment worked at the classifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
and cataloguing of 35,000 volumes. He distributed
them into methodical classes, and devoted nine
years&mdash;1675 to 1684&mdash;to his work. But this first unravelling
was soon insufficient. Less than four years
after, he commenced a new inventory in twenty-one
volumes, which occupied thirty years, having been
finished in the course of March, 1714. This time the
numbers amounted to 43,000 printed volumes; his
twenty-three principal divisions, containing all the
letters of the alphabet, are very nearly preserved up to
our day. In 1697 the question of publishing this enormous
work was agitated, and on this point Cl&eacute;ment had
a curious correspondence with a learned Dane named
Frederick Bostgaard; he also, in a celebrated pamphlet,
<i>Id&eacute;e d'une Nouvelle Mani&egrave;re de dresser le Catalogue d'une
Biblioth&egrave;que</i>, indicated practical observations; he resolved
this arduous question for important collections by
difference of sizes; but his project was not executed,
although favoured from the first by Abb&eacute; Bignon.</p>

<p>As the collection was not available for workers, the
work of Cl&eacute;ment had only a relative importance. A
councillor of the Prince of Waldeck, a German of the
name of Nemeitz, who travelled in France in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, having seen it in the
houses of the Rue Vivienne, says that the library
occupied then twenty-six rooms and contained 75,000
volumes in all; it was shown voluntarily to strangers,
but not to the public. Nemeitz gives some other
curious particulars as to the libraries of Paris (<i>S&eacute;jour
&agrave; Paris:</i> Leyde, 1727, 8vo).</p>

<p>The bank of Law, that had been lodged for some
time in the Hotel de Nevers, alienated by the heirs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
Mazarin, soon disappeared with the ruin of his system.
As we have said above, Bignon appreciated the
importance of the neglected palace for commodiously
lodging the royal collections. This was in 1721. The
collection was about to be subdivided into four sections,
or, as they were then called in the administrative style,
four distinct departments: manuscripts, printed books,
titles, and engraved plates. The master of the library
pressed the Regent to profit by the occasion, to which
he agreed. In the month of September the removal
commenced, and from the Rue Vivienne, the royal
library, the first in the world and the most valuable,
as Naud&eacute; says, entered the former palace of the Cardinal,
which it was never to quit again.</p>

<p>We approach the epoch when this great scientific establishment
was to quit its private character and to open
its doors to the learned of all countries. In 1735 it was
decided to print the catalogue of some divisions only:
theology, canonical law, public law, and <i>belles lettres</i>.
This resolution coincided precisely with the opening of
the doors which took place in 1737, in which year
appeared the first volume of the catalogue comprising
the sacred Scriptures. At the end of the eighteenth
century the royal library was finally established; the
printed books then comprised about 200,000 volumes,
and access was had by a staircase leading to six
grand saloons, which were surrounded by galleries.
From this moment the rooms became too small. At
the Revolution the number of books had increased
to 300,000, and projects of enlargement commenced, to
be continued to our time; but, in spite of these proposals,
the surface occupied by the library has remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
the same since the time of Louis XV. Enlargements
and alterations have been made year after year on the
same ground without much new construction. But
how the treasures have been augmented to this time!
If the printed books at the Revolution represented
a little more than 300,000 volumes, to-day they exceed
two millions; the prints number two and a half
millions; the medals, 100,000; the manuscripts, something
over 90,000.</p>

<p>If we have thus brought the summary history of the
National Library of Paris to our days, it was to avoid
mixing it with other matters. We have entered into
such detail regarding it as is fitting for the most
important library in the world. We now return to the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>At the time when Henri IV. carried from Fontainebleau
to Paris the nucleus of volumes that was to have
so brilliant a destiny, the passion for books had
singularly spread itself in France. We have already
spoken of Mazarin; after him Cardinal Richelieu
designed to open his private collection to the public,
and in his will he manifested his clearly held intention.
He went further in his last wishes: he prescribed the
daily sweeping and dusting of the precious collection,
and its augmentation by a thousand livres tournois each
year. The great personages of the time were not
behind; and Sauval says that in the seventeenth century
there were 1,000 or 1,200 private libraries in Paris,
numbering 1,700,000 volumes.</p>

<p>In the provinces there were few public libraries. The
communities and learned Societies, the Jesuits and
other religious houses, and the universities had collections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
At Orleans a library was opened for Germans,
and the students of that country were able to work at
their ease under the supervision of two librarians.</p>

<p>At the end of the eighteenth century the number of
libraries had increased in large proportions; the
amateurs had made their influence felt. The Book was
not sought only for what it contained, but also for
its exterior clothing. Only the great libraries open to
everybody remained eclectic, and provided a little of
everything. Besides the royal library, there were in
Paris a great number of other collections, which the
revolutionary storm upset and often destroyed. That
of St. Germain des Pr&egrave;s was burnt in 1794. That of
St. Genevi&egrave;ve, founded in 1625, had benefited by
celebrated donations, among others those of the
cardinals De Berulle and De la Rochefoucauld; the
Arsenal, created by the Marquis de Paulmy, was
successively enriched by important acquisitions, among
which was the collection of the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re.
These collections still exist, and are open to the
public, as also are the National Library, the Mazarine,
the Sorbonne, the Museum, the School of Fine Arts,
the City of Paris, the Institute, the Louvre, and the
several scientific faculties.</p>

<p>The provinces have not been behind in the movement.
Many of the great cities contain a considerable number
of books easily accessible, among them the libraries of
Bordeaux and Rouen, amounting to 150,000 volumes;
Troyes and Besan&ccedil;on, 100,000, etc. Few important
centres have less than 20,000. These collections have
been generally composed of those of the religious
establishments, closed by the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>In our time public libraries are augmented by the
legal deposit, gifts of the State, legacies of private
persons, and purchases. The legal deposit in France
relates almost exclusively to the National Library, and
proceeds from the measures taken by Henri II. in 1556.
Each French printer has now to deposit a certain
number of copies of the works that he issues, and these
volumes go to swell the number of books in the Rue
de Richelieu. At the rate of 30,000 a year, the time
is easily anticipated and very near when the space will
be found insufficient. Some measures will have to be
taken.</p>

<p>Germany, the cradle of printing, was not favoured in
the beginning. It had, however, in the seventeenth
century, in Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, a little town in the duchy of
Brunswick, a curious collection of books, in a detached
building, of which the engraver Merian has preserved
for us the physiognomy; it contained nearly 200,000
volumes, an enormous number for the time. The rather
low rooms were shelved all round; in the middle were
cases of the height of a man, also filled with books; the
readers helped themselves, and were seated for working.
The exterior of the building, without being sumptuous,
was isolated and detached. In our time this collection
includes the Bible, glass, and inkstand of Luther and his
portrait by Lucas Cranach.</p>

<p>Another curious library, dating from the beginning
of the seventeenth century, is that of the city of
Leyden. An engraving by Woudan shows its state in
1610, with its classifications and divisions. The books
were ranged in cases provided with breast-high desks.
The books were placed with the edges in front, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
not as now, and were so attached that they could only
be consulted in their place. Each body of shelving
contained a series of authors: theology, philosophy,
mathematics, history, medicine, law, and literature.
The room, of square shape, was lighted by windows
right and left. Between the bays were portraits, views
of cities, and maps. On the right, in a shrine, was
enclosed the legacy of Joseph Scaliger. Communication
was less liberal than at Wolfenb&uuml;ttel; the readers were
obliged to take the books from the shelves themselves
and read them standing before the desks.</p>

<p>In England, the celebrated Oxford Library should be
mentioned, augmented and restored in 1597 by Sir
Thomas Bodley, ambassador of Queen Elizabeth. The
generous overtures of this rich gentleman met with
unanimous approbation. He offered to the library
of the university the volumes collected by him during
his travels on the Continent, whose value exceeded
&pound;10,000. The first stone of a new building was laid
in 1610, but from 1602 the collection was open to
readers in a provisional locality. David Loggan, the
engraver, has preserved for us interior views of the
Bodleian of the seventeenth century. The rooms are
disposed in the form of the letter H, with pavilions to
east and west, united by a gallery. The books were
and are still in the body of the library, placed against
the walls, with tables and immovable seats. The
volumes were not displaced; they were consulted in
their own place. Each room had two floors, with
access to the second by stairs.</p>

<p>In London it was Hans Sloane who had the idea of
founding a great collection by offering to the State for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
&pound;20,000 his collection of books, which was valued at
&pound;50,000. Created in 1753 by an Act of Parliament,
the British Museum, as it was named, was quickly
augmented by many private libraries, among which
was the library of printed books and manuscripts collected
by the kings of England from Henry VII. to
William III., which was added in the reign of George II.
The very extensive and valuable library of George III.,
250,000 volumes, was added by George IV. The
Harleian collection added 7,500 volumes, and Robert
Cotton his manuscripts. To-day the printed books
amount to 1,300,000, and are only surpassed by the
National Library of France as well in number of
books as in number of readers. This immense collection
increases at a great rate, one source being the
compulsory deposit of a copy of every new book in
order to secure copyright. Donations and legacies
are constantly being made, and an annual sum for
purchases is voted by Parliament. Besides the copy
deposited by publishers in the British Museum, the
law of copyright compels the deposit of four other
copies, which go to augment the collections of the
Bodleian Library of Oxford, the University Library
of Cambridge, and the libraries of Edinburgh and
Dublin.</p>

<p>If we search among the cities of Europe where establishments
of this kind are most honoured, Berlin will
take the third place with 900,000 printed books and
20,000 manuscripts, preserved in the Imperial Library.
The building, constructed between 1775 and 1780, owes
its special form to Frederick II., who desired that it
should take the form of a chest of drawers. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the fa&ccedil;ade an inscription in the Latin tongue, but conceived
in German spirit, indicates that here is a spiritual
refectory&mdash;<i>nutrimentum spiritus</i>. Following come
Munich, with 800,000 printed books; Vienna 400,000;
Dresden, 300,000; then the universities: Leipzig,
whose library, founded in 1409 and reorganised in
1830, contains 150,000 books and 2,000 manuscripts;
Heidelberg; G&ouml;ttingen, etc.</p>

<p>In Italy, Florence keeps, in the National Library,
300,000 volumes, proceeding from various amateurs, and
formed since 1860. The collection of the goldsmith
Magliabecchi, that was open to readers since 1747, has
been transported there. Besides this library, Florence
possesses the celebrated Laurentian, created by Cosmo
de Medicis in the middle of the fifteenth century, where
are united more than 8,000 manuscripts of an incalculable
value. Milan has at the Brera a collection of
200,000 printed books and 50,000 medals, and at the
Ambrosian, due to Cardinal Frederick Borromeo,
160,000 printed books and 8,000 manuscripts.</p>

<p>Rome possesses a dozen collections and celebrated
deposits. The Vatican, not numerous, is most choice;
the importance of its manuscripts is known to the entire
world, but only a part of the 50,000 printed books are
catalogued. The Library of Victor Emmanuel, formerly
of the Jesuits, amounts to about 66,000 volumes. At
Venice the splendid monument called the Antiqua
Libraria di St. Marco has changed its destination;
constructed in the sixteenth century and commenced
by Sansovino for a library, it is now a royal palace.
This city has lost that which had made its glory, and
its collections are very modest in our days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>The magnificent educational establishments in the
form of public libraries provided in the United States
deserve special mention. Nearly every city has its
public library, supported by a small tax; and many
large libraries are wholly supported by private munificence.
The first to be established was founded in 1732
by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia, and still exists
as the Library Company; many important bequests
have been made to it, the latest being &pound;200,000 by
Dr. Richard Rush. The library now numbers 150,000
volumes. The Congressional Library of Washington,
besides its annual income from Government, receives
by deposit for copyright a copy of every work published
in the United States; it now has 565,000
volumes.</p>

<p>The Astor Library and the Lenox Library of New
York were both founded and endowed by the families
whose name they bear; the former has 223,284
volumes, the latter 25,000. The city of Chicago recently
fell heir to the magnificent sum of over one
million sterling for the establishment of a library of
reference, and New York was benefited by the late
Mr. Tilden to the extent of &pound;800,000 for a public
library.</p>

<p>When we have named the libraries of St. Petersburg
and Moscow for Russia, Stockholm for Sweden, and
the Escurial for Spain, we shall have mentioned very
hastily the most important establishments in the world.
For more than four centuries the love of books has
preserved and fortified itself, and increases each day.
If we were to endeavour to approximately imagine
the number of printed books diffused, we should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
frightened at it. It is by miles that to-day are
counted the shelves of the National Library or of the
British Museum; and each year the production is
accelerated, as is also the number of readers.</p>
